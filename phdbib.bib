abstract = {Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show patterns of change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that precede dementia. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studied normal controls (NC), subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjects with AD to identify patterns of biomarkers to aid in early diagnosis and effective treatment of AD. Two hundred twenty-two NC underwent baseline MRI and clinical examination at baseline and at least one follow-up. One hundred twelve also provided CSF at baseline. Unsupervised clustering based on initial CSF and MRI measures was used to identify clusters of participants with similar profiles. Repeated measures regression modeling assessed the relationship of individual measures, and of cluster membership, to cognitive change over 3 years. Most individuals showed little cognitive change. Individual biomarkers had limited predictive value for cognitive decline, but membership in the cluster with the most extreme profile was associated with more rapid decline in ADAS-cog. Subtypes among NC based on multiple biomarkers may represent the earliest stages of subclinical cognitive decline and AD. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Interpretablc modeling of heterogeneous data channels is essential in medical applications, for example when jointly analyzing clinical scores and medical images. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are powerful generative models that learn representations of complex data. The flexibility of VAE may come at the expense of lack of interpretability in describing the joint relationship between heterogeneous data. To tackle this problem, in this work we extend the variational framework of VAE to bring parsimony and interpretability when jointly account for latent relationships across multiple channels. In the latent space, this is achieved by constraining the variational distribution of each channel to a common target prior. Parsimonious latent representations are enforced by variational dropout. Experiments on synthetic data show that our model correctly identifies the prescribed latent dimensions and data relationships across multiple testing scenarios. When applied to imaging and clinical data, our method allows to identify the joint effect of age and pathology in describing clinical condition in a large scale clinical cohort.},

abstract = {Longitudinal neuroimaging data plays an important role in mapping the neural developmental profile of major neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and normal brain. The development of such developmental maps is critical for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of many brain-related diseases. The aim of this paper is to develop a spatio-temporal Gaussian process (STGP) framework to accurately delineate the developmental trajectories of brain structure and function, while achieving better prediction by explicitly incorporating the spatial and temporal features of longitudinal neuroimaging data. Our STGP integrates a functional principal component model (FPCA) and a partition parametric space-time covariance model to capture the medium-to-large and small-to-medium spatio-temporal dependence structures, respectively. We develop a three-stage efficient estimation procedure as well as a predictive method based on a kriging technique. Two key novelties of STGP are that it can efficiently use a small number of parameters to capture complex non-stationary and non-separable spatio-temporal dependence structures and that it can accurately predict spatio-temporal changes. We illustrate STGP using simulated data sets and two real data analyses including longitudinal positron emission tomography data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and longitudinal lateral ventricle surface data from a longitudinal study of early brain development.},

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

It also covers the computation-graph abstraction, which allows to easily define and train arbitrary neural networks, and is the basis behind the design of contemporary neural network software libraries. The second part of the book (Parts III and IV) introduces more specialized neural network architectures, including 1D convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, conditioned-generation models, and attention-based models. These architectures and techniques are the driving force behind state-of-the-art algorithms for machine translation, syntactic parsing, and many other applications. Finally, we also discuss tree-shaped networks, structured prediction, and the prospects of multi-task learning.},

New methods are needed to successfully leverage and distill meaningful information on the progression of the disease from the deluge of available data. Machine learning has been used successfully for many different tasks, including neuroimaging related problems. In this paper, we review recent statistical and machine learning applications in Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal neuroimaging. Methods: We search for papers using longitudinal imaging data, focused on Alzheimer's Disease and published between 2007 and 2019 on four different search engines. Results: After the search, we obtain 104 relevant papers. We analyze their approach to typical challenges in longitudinal data analysis, such as missing data and variability in the number and extent of acquisitions. Conclusions: Reviewed works show that machine learning methods using longitudinal data have potential for disease progression modelling and computer-aided diagnosis. We compare results and models, and propose future research directions in the field.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifestation in the pre-dementia stage facilitates the selection of appropriate measures for early detection and disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the trajectories of cognitive performance, gray matter volume (GMV), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, together with the influence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) in subjects with amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits across the pre-clinical to dementia stages of AD. METHODS: 356 subjects were dichotomized into Abeta+ and Abeta- groups based on their CSF Abeta1-42 level. We derived AD-related atrophic regions (AD-ROIs) using the voxel-based morphometry approach. We characterized the trajectories of cognitive scores, GMV at AD-ROIs, and CSF biomarkers from preclinical to disease stages in Abeta+ subjects. The effect of APOE epsilon4 genotype on these trajectories was examined. RESULTS: Impairments in executive functioning/processing speed (EF/PS) and atrophy at the right supramarginal/inferior parietal gyrus were detected in cognitively normal Abeta+ subjects. Together with the APOE epsilon4 carrier status, these measures showed potential to identify cognitively normal elderly with abnormal CSF Abeta1-42 level in another independent cohort. Subsequently, impairment in memory, visuospatial, language, and attention as well as atrophy in the temporal lobe, thalamus, and mid-cingulate cortex were detectable in Abeta+ mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. In MCI and dementia Abeta+ subjects, epsilon4 carriers had more severe atrophy of the medial temporal lobe and memory impairment but higher EF/PS compared to non-carriers. CONCLUSIONS: EF/PS decline and right parietal atrophy might act as non-invasive screening tests for abnormal amyloid deposition in cognitively normal elderly. APOE modulation on subsequent trajectories in cognition and atrophy should be taken into account when analyzing disease progression.},

Biomarkers based on standard blood test results would be useful in research, drug development, and clinical practice. Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) has recently been proposed as a blood-based biomarker for neurodegeneration in dementias. Objective To test whether plasma NFL concentrations are increased in AD and associated with cognitive decline, other AD biomarkers, and imaging evidence of neurodegeneration. Design, Setting, and Participants In this prospective case-control study, an ultrasensitive assay was used to measure plasma NFL concentration in 193 cognitively healthy controls, 197 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 180 patients with AD dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The study dates were September 7, 2005, to February 13, 2012. The plasma NFL analysis was performed in September 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures Associations were tested between plasma NFL and diagnosis, A$\beta$ pathologic features, CSF biomarkers of neuronal injury, cognition, brain structure, and metabolism. Results Among 193 cognitively healthy controls, 197 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 180 patients with AD with dementia, plasma NFL correlated with CSF NFL (Spearman $\rho$ = 0.59, P {\textless} .001). Plasma NFL was increased in patients with MCI (mean, 42.8 ng/L) and patients with AD dementia (mean, 51.0 ng/L) compared with controls (mean, 34.7 ng/L) (P {\textless} .001) and had high diagnostic accuracy for patients with AD with dementia vs controls (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.87, which is comparable to established CSF biomarkers). Plasma NFL was particularly high in patients with MCI and patients with AD dementia with A$\beta$ pathologic features. High plasma NFL correlated with poor cognition and AD-related atrophy (at baseline and longitudinally) and with brain hypometabolism (longitudinally). Conclusions and Relevance Plasma NFL is associated with AD diagnosis and with cognitive, biochemical, and imaging hallmarks of the disease. This finding implies a potential usefulness for plasma NFL as a noninvasive biomarker in AD.},

abstract = {At the earliest clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), when first symptoms are mild, making a reliable and accurate diagnosis is difficult. AD related brain pathology and underlying molecular mechanisms precede symptoms. Biological markers can serve as supportive early screening and diagnostic tools as well as indicators of presymptomatic biochemical change. Moreover, biomarkers cover a variety of roles and functions such as disease prediction, indicating disease acuity and progression, and may ensure biological mapping of treatment outcome. Early screening, detection, and diagnosis of AD would permit earlier disease modifying intervention at potentially reversible stages. To date, most established biological markers from both cerebrospinal fluid neurochemistry and structural and functional neuroimaging have not reached widespread clinical application. Crucial remaining problems, such as easy acceptance and application of a test, cost-effectiveness, and noninvasiveness, need to be resolved. The development and validation of precise, reliable, and robust tests and biomarkers in blood, plasma, or serum has therefore been for a long time the ultimate focus of many research groups worldwide. Blood-based testing will most likely be the prerequisite to future sensitive screening of large populations at risk of AD and the baseline in a diagnostic flow approach to AD. The status and emerging perspectives on hypothesis and exploratory-based candidate biomarkers derived from blood, plasma, and serum are reviewed and discussed.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease causes a progressive dementia that currently affects over 35  million individuals worldwide and is expected to affect 115 million by 2050 (ref. 1). There are no cures or disease-modifying therapies, and this may be due to our inability to detect the disease before it has progressed to produce evident memory loss and functional decline. Biomarkers of preclinical disease will be critical to the development of disease-modifying or even preventative therapies. Unfortunately, current biomarkers for early disease, including cerebrospinal fluid tau and amyloid-beta levels, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and the recent use of brain amyloid imaging or inflammaging, are limited because they are either invasive, time-consuming or expensive. Blood-based biomarkers may be a more attractive option, but none can currently detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease with the required sensitivity and specificity. Herein, we describe our lipidomic approach to detecting preclinical Alzheimer's disease in a group of cognitively normal older adults. We discovered and validated a set of ten lipids from peripheral blood that predicted phenoconversion to either amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease within a 2-3 year timeframe with over 90{\%} accuracy. This biomarker panel, reflecting cell membrane integrity, may be sensitive to early neurodegeneration of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is challenging because of its heterogeneity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a stratification method on different cohorts and to investigate whether stratification in amnestic MCI could improve prediction accuracy. METHODS: We identified 80 and 79 patients with amnestic MCI from different cohorts, respectively. They underwent baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans. We performed hierarchical clustering with three imaging biomarkers: Brain volume on MRI, left hippocampus grey matter loss on MRI, and left inferior temporal gyrus glucose hypometabolism on FDG-PET. Regions-of-interest for biomarkers were defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas. We performed voxel-wise statistical parametric mapping to explore differences between clusters in patterns of grey matter loss and glucose hypometabolism. We compared time to progression using an interval-censored parametric model. We evaluated predictive performance using logistic regression. RESULTS: Similar clusters were found in different cohorts. MCI1 had the healthiest biomarker profile of cognitive performance and imaging biomarkers. MCI2 had cognitive performance and MRI measures intermediate between those of nonconverters and converters. MCI3 showed the severest reduction in brain volume and left hippocampal atrophy. MCI4 showed remarkable glucose hypometabolism in the left inferior temporal gyrus, and also demonstrated significant decreases in most cognitive scores, including non-memory functions. MCI4 showed the highest risk for progression. The prediction of progression of MCI2 especially benefited from the stratification. CONCLUSION: Stratification with imaging biomarkers in amnestic MCI can be a good approach for improving predictive performance.},

abstract = {Recent genetic and proteomic studies demonstrate that clusterin/apolipoprotein-J is associated with risk, pathology, and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our main aim was to examine associations between plasma clusterin concentration and longitudinal changes in brain volume in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A secondary objective was to examine associations between peripheral concentration of clusterin and its concentration in the brain within regions that undergo neuropathological changes in AD. Non-demented individuals (N = 139; mean baseline age 70.5 years) received annual volumetric MRI (912 MRI scans in total) over a mean six-year interval. Sixteen participants (92 MRI scans in total) were diagnosed during the course of the study with amnestic MCI. Clusterin concentration was assayed by ELISA in plasma samples collected within a year of the baseline MRI. Mixed effects regression models investigated whether plasma clusterin concentration was associated with rates of brain atrophy for control and MCI groups and whether these associations differed between groups. In a separate autopsy sample of individuals with AD (N = 17) and healthy controls (N = 4), we examined the association between antemortem clusterin concentration in plasma and postmortem levels in the superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus and cerebellum. The associations of plasma clusterin concentration with rates of change in brain volume were significantly different between MCI and control groups in several volumes including whole brain, ventricular CSF, temporal gray matter as well as parahippocampal, superior temporal and cingulate gyri. Within the MCI but not control group, higher baseline concentration of plasma clusterin was associated with slower rates of brain atrophy in these regions. In the combined autopsy sample of AD and control cases, representing a range of severity in AD pathology, we observed a significant association between clusterin concentration in the plasma and that in the superior temporal gyrus. Our findings suggest that clusterin, a plasma protein with roles in amyloid clearance, complement inhibition and apoptosis, is associated with rate of brain atrophy in MCI. Furthermore, peripheral concentration of clusterin also appears to reflect its concentration within brain regions vulnerable to AD pathology. These findings in combination suggest an influence of this multi-functional protein on early stages of progression in AD pathology. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

Blood-based biomarkers have significant advantages of being time- and cost-efficient as well as reduced invasiveness and increased patient acceptance.

In addition, a collaborative model is proposed that leverages academic and industry strengths to facilitate the field in moving past discovery only work and toward clinical use.

In the current study, levels of the previously described novel cerebrospinal fluid aberrant protein complex composed of prostaglandin-D-synthase (PDS) and transthyretin (TTR) were quantified in plasma by a custom two-probe sandwich ELISA and compared to amyloid-beta (Abeta)(1-42) as a standard plasma biomarker of AD. Plasma was analyzed from 140 probable AD subjects, 135 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 74 normal control subjects (NC) prior to MCI transition, 23 diseased control (DC) subjects with either frontotemporal dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies, and 182 normal control (NC) subjects who did not progress to MCI or dementia. Levels of Abeta(1-42) were significantly elevated in NC subjects prior to MCI conversion but significantly reduced in probable AD subjects compared to NC subjects. Similarly, levels of the PDS-TTR complex were significantly reduced in both MCI and probable AD subjects compared to NC subjects. Furthermore, levels of Abeta(1-42) and the PDS-TTR complex were not significantly different in DC subjects compared to NC subjects. MMSE scores were weakly but significantly correlated with plasma levels of the PDS-TTR complex and Abeta(1-42). Trail B scores were weakly but significantly correlated with plasma levels of Abeta(1-42). Comparison of receiver operating curves shows the PDS-TTR complex is comparable to Abeta(1-42) in both MCI and probable AD subjects.},

The model aims to describe the longitudinal progression of ADAS-cog scores from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative trial that had data from 198 MCI subjects with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) information who were followed for 3 years. METHOD: Various covariates were tested on disease progression parameters and these variables fell into six categories: imaging volumetrics, biochemical, genetic, demographic, cognitive tests and CSF biomarkers. RESULTS: CSF biomarkers were associated with both baseline disease score and disease progression rate in subjects with MCI. Baseline disease score was also correlated with atrophy measured using hippocampal volume. Progression rate was also predicted by executive functioning as measured by the Trail B-test. CONCLUSION: CSF biomarkers have the ability to discriminate MCI subjects into sub-populations that exhibit markedly different rates of disease progression on the ADAS-cog scale. These biomarkers can therefore be utilized for designing clinical trials enriched with subjects that carry the underlying disease pathology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: To identify prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects using a  data-driven approach to determine cognitive profiles in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: A total of 881 MCI subjects were recruited from 20 memory clinics and followed for up to 5 years. Outcome measures included cognitive variables, conversion to AD, and biomarkers (e.g. CSF, and MRI markers). Two hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) were performed to identify clusters of subjects with distinct cognitive profiles. The first HCA included all subjects with complete cognitive data, whereas the second one selected subjects with very mild MCI (MMSE {\textgreater}/=28). ANOVAs and ANCOVAs were computed to examine whether the clusters differed with regard to conversion to AD, and to AD-specific biomarkers. RESULTS: The HCAs identified 4-cluster solutions that best reflected the sample structure. One cluster (aMCIsingle) had a significantly higher conversion rate (19{\%}), compared to subjective cognitive impairment (SCI, p {\textless} 0.0001), and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI, p = 0.012). This cluster was the only one showing a significantly different biomarker profile (Abeta42, t-tau, APOE epsilon4, and medial temporal atrophy), compared to SCI or naMCI. CONCLUSION: In subjects with mild MCI, the single-domain amnestic MCI profile was associated with the highest risk of conversion, even if memory impairment did not necessarily cross specific cut-off points. A cognitive profile characterized by isolated memory deficits may be sufficient to warrant applying prevention strategies in MCI, whether or not memory performance lies below specific z-scores. This is supported by our preliminary biomarker analyses. However, further analyses with bigger samples are needed to corroborate these findings.},

abstract = {Abstract In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association created separate diagnostic recommendations for the preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. Scientific progress in the interim led to an initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This unifying update is labeled a "research framework" because its intended use is for observational and interventional research, not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or in vivo by biomarkers. The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which shifts the definition of AD in living people from a syndromal to a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are grouped into those of $\beta$ amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [AT(N)]. This ATN classification system groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the pathologic process each measures. The AT(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing AT(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond AT(N) can be added when they become available. We focus on AD as a continuum, and cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures. However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this framework seeks to create a common language with which investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study. Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse populations. Although it is possible that $\beta$-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in AD pathogenesis, it is these abnormal protein deposits that define AD as a unique neurodegenerative disease among different disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining AD as a biological construct will enable a more accurate characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with AD, as well as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process and in the appropriate people.},

abstract = {In 2010, we put forward a hypothetical model of the major biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model was received with interest because we described the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers in relation to each other and to the onset and progression of clinical symptoms. Since then, evidence has accumulated that supports the major assumptions of this model. Evidence has also appeared that challenges some of our assumptions, which has allowed us to modify our original model. Refinements to our model include indexing of individuals by time rather than clinical symptom severity; incorporation of interindividual variability in cognitive impairment associated with progression of AD pathophysiology; modifications of the specific temporal ordering of some biomarkers; and recognition that the two major proteinopathies underlying AD biomarker changes, amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) and tau, might be initiated independently in sporadic AD, in which we hypothesise that an incident A$\beta$ pathophysiology can accelerate antecedent limbic and brainstem tauopathy.{\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Peripheral biomarkers of disease state may improve clinical trial design and analysis, increasing the likelihood of successful drug development.

abstract = {Background: Neurofibrillary pathology has a stereotypical progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is encapsulated in the Braak staging scheme; however, some AD cases are atypical and do not fit into this scheme. We aimed to compare clinical and neuropathological features between typical and atypical AD cases. Methods: AD cases with a Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage of more than IV were identified from a brain bank database. By use of thioflavin-S fluorescence microscopy, we assessed the density and the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in three cortical regions and two hippocampal sectors. These data were used to construct an algorithm to classify AD cases into typical, hippocampal sparing, or limbic predominant. Classified cases were then compared for clinical, demographic, pathological, and genetic characteristics. An independent cohort of AD cases was assessed to validate findings from the initial cohort. Findings: 889 cases of AD, 398 men and 491 women with age at death of 37-103 years, were classified with the algorithm as hippocampal sparing (97 cases [11{\%}]), typical (665 [75{\%}]), or limbic predominant (127 [14{\%}]). By comparison with typical AD, neurofibrillary tangle counts per 0.125 mm2in hippocampal sparing cases were higher in cortical areas (median 13, IQR 11-16) and lower in the hippocampus (7.5, 5.2-9.5), whereas counts in limbic-predominant cases were lower in cortical areas (4.3, 3.0-5.7) and higher in the hippocampus (27, 22-35). Hippocampal sparing cases had less hippocampal atrophy than did typical and limbic-predominant cases. Patients with hippocampal sparing AD were younger at death (mean 72 years [SD 10]) and a higher proportion of them were men (61 [63{\%}]), whereas those with limbic-predominant AD were older (mean 86 years [SD 6]) and a higher proportion of them were women (87 [69{\%}]). Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) H1H1 genotype was more common in limbic-predominant AD (54 [70{\%}]) than in hippocampal sparing AD (24 [46{\%}]; p=0.011), but did not differ significantly between limbic-predominant and typical AD (204 [59{\%}]; p=0.11). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e{\{}open{\}}4 allele status differed between AD subtypes only when data were stratified by age at onset. Clinical presentation, age at onset, disease duration, and rate of cognitive decline differed between the AD subtypes. These findings were confirmed in a validation cohort of 113 patients with AD. Interpretation: These data support the hypothesis that AD has distinct clinicopathological subtypes. Hippocampal sparing and limbic-predominant AD subtypes might account for about 25{\%} of cases, and hence should be considered when designing clinical, genetic, biomarker, and treatment studies in patients with AD.

Here we present Cancer Integration via Multikernel Learning (CIMLR; based on an algorithm originally developed for analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data), a new cancer subtyping method that integrates multi-omic data to reveal molecular subtypes of cancer. We apply CIMLR to multi-omic data from 32 cancer types and show significant improvements in both computational efficiency and ability to extract biologically meaningful cancer subtypes. The discovered subtypes exhibit significant differences in patient survival for 21 of the 32 studied cancer types. Our analysis reveals integrated patterns of gene expression, methylation, point mutations and copy number changes in multiple cancers and highlights patterns specifically associated with poor patient outcomes.},

METHODS Amyloid-beta 1 to 42 peptide (A beta(1-42)), total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated at the threonine 181 were measured in (1) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained during baseline evaluation of 100 mild AD, 196 mild cognitive impairment, and 114 elderly cognitively normal (NC) subjects in ADNI; and (2) independent 56 autopsy-confirmed AD cases and 52 age-matched elderly NCs using a multiplex immunoassay. Detection of an AD CSF profile for t-tau and A beta(1-42) in ADNI subjects was achieved using receiver operating characteristic cut points and logistic regression models derived from the autopsy-confirmed CSF data. RESULTS CSF A beta(1-42) was the most sensitive biomarker for AD in the autopsy cohort of CSF samples: receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.913 and sensitivity for AD detection of 96.4{\%}. In the ADNI cohort, a logistic regression model for A beta(1-42), t-tau, and APO epsilon 4 allele count provided the best assessment delineation of mild AD. An AD-like baseline CSF profile for t-tau/A beta(1-42) was detected in 33 of 37 ADNI mild cognitive impairment subjects who converted to probable AD during the first year of the study. INTERPRETATION The CSF biomarker signature of AD defined by A beta(1-42) and t-tau in the autopsy-confirmed AD cohort and confirmed in the cohort followed in ADNI for 12 months detects mild AD in a large, multisite, prospective clinical investigation, and this signature appears to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD.},

abstract = {Background: Three subtypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been pathologically defined on the basis of the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles: typical AD, hippocampal-sparing AD, and limbic-predominant AD. Compared with typical AD, hippocampal-sparing AD has more neurofibrillary tangles in the cortex and fewer in the hippocampus, whereas the opposite pattern is seen in limbic-predominant AD. We aimed to determine whether MRI patterns of atrophy differ between these subtypes and whether structural neuroimaging could be a useful predictor of pathological subtype at autopsy. Methods: We identified patients who had been followed up in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Rochester, MN, USA) or in the Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry (Rochester, MN, USA) between 1992 and 2005. To be eligible for inclusion, participants had to have had dementia, AD pathology at autopsy (Braak stage ≥IV and intermediate to high probability of AD), and an ante-mortem MRI. Cases were assigned to one of three pathological subtypes-hippocampal-sparing, limbic-predominant, and typical AD-on the basis of neurofibrillary tangle counts in hippocampus and cortex and ratio of hippocampal to cortical burden, without reference to neuronal loss. Voxel-based morphometry and atlas-based parcellation were used to compare patterns of grey matter loss between groups and with age-matched control individuals. Neuroimaging was obtained at the time of first presentation. To summarise pair-wise group differences, we report the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Findings: Of 177 eligible patients, 125 (71{\%}) were classified as having typical AD, 33 (19{\%}) as having limbic-predominant AD, and 19 (11{\%}) as having hippocampal-sparing AD. Most patients with typical (98 [78{\%}]) and limbic-predominant AD (31 [94{\%}]) initially presented with an amnestic syndrome, but fewer patients with hippocampal-sparing AD (eight [42{\%}]) did. The most severe medial temporal atrophy was recorded in patients with limbic-predominant AD, followed by those with typical disease, and then those with hippocampal-sparing AD. Conversely, the most severe cortical atrophy was noted in patients with hippocampal-sparing AD, followed by those with typical disease, and then limbic-predominant AD. The ratio of hippocampal to cortical volumes allowed the best discrimination between subtypes (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001; three-way AUROC 0{\textperiodcentered}52 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}47-0{\textperiodcentered}52]; ratio of AUROC to chance classification 3{\textperiodcentered}1 [2{\textperiodcentered}8-3{\textperiodcentered}1]). Patients with typical AD and non-amnesic initial presentation had a significantly higher ratio of hippocampal to cortical volumes (median 0{\textperiodcentered}045 [IQR 0{\textperiodcentered}035-0{\textperiodcentered}056]) than did those with an amnesic presentation (0{\textperiodcentered}041 [0{\textperiodcentered}031-0{\textperiodcentered}057]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}001). Interpretation: Patterns of atrophy on MRI differ across the pathological subtypes of AD. MRI regional volumetric analysis can reliably track the distribution of neurofibrillary tangle pathology and can predict pathological subtype of AD at autopsy.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Because the signs associated with dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD) can be heterogeneous, the goal of this study was to use 3-dimensional MRI to examine the various patterns of cortical atrophy that can be associated with dementia of AD type, and to investigate whether AD dementia can be categorized into anatomical subtypes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: High-resolution T1-weighted volumetric MRIs were taken of 152 patients in their earlier stages of AD dementia. The images were processed to measure cortical thickness, and hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was performed using Ward's clustering linkage. The identified clusters of patients were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group using a general linear model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There were several distinct patterns of cortical atrophy and the number of patterns varied according to the level of cluster analyses. At the 3-cluster level, patients were divided into (1) bilateral medial temporal-dominant atrophy subtype (n = 52, ∼ 34.2{\%}), (2) parietal-dominant subtype (n = 28, ∼ 18.4{\%}) in which the bilateral parietal lobes, the precuneus, along with bilateral dorsolateral frontal lobes, were atrophic, and (3) diffuse atrophy subtype (n = 72, ∼ 47.4{\%}) in which nearly all association cortices revealed atrophy. These 3 subtypes also differed in their demographic and clinical features.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This cluster analysis of cortical thickness of the entire brain showed that AD dementia in the earlier stages can be categorized into various anatomical subtypes, with distinct clinical features.},

We hypothesized that these effects could be related to vascular damage. Fifty-three individuals in the suspected vascular cluster (Normal 2) were compared with 31 individuals from the cluster characterized as healthy/typical (Normal 1) on a variety of outcomes, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, vascular risk factors and outcomes, cognitive trajectory, and medications for vascular conditions. Normal 2 was significantly older but did not differ on ApoE4+ prevalence. Normal 2 differed significantly from Normal 1 on all MRI measures but not on Amyloid-Beta1-42 or total tau protein. Normal 2 had significantly higher body mass index (BMI), Hachinksi score, and creatinine levels, and took significantly more medications for vascular conditions. Normal 2 had marginally significantly higher triglycerides and blood glucose. Normal 2 had a worse cognitive trajectory on the Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) 30-min delay test and the Functional Activity Questionnaire (FAQ). Cerebral atrophy associated with multiple vascular risks is common among cognitively normal individuals, forming a distinct subgroup with significantly increased cognitive decline. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical impact of these findings.},

We hypothesized that ADNI mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects would also exhibit heterogeneity with possible clinical implications. METHODS: ADNI subjects diagnosed with amnestic MCI (n=138) were clustered based on baseline magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum biomarkers. The clusters were compared with respect to longitudinal atrophy, cognitive trajectory, and time to conversion. RESULTS: Four clusters emerged with distinct biomarker patterns: The first cluster was biologically similar to normal controls and rarely converted to Alzheimer's disease (AD) during follow-up. The second cluster had characteristics of early Alzheimer's pathology. The third cluster showed the most severe atrophy but barely abnormal tau levels and a substantial proportion converted to clinical AD. The fourth cluster appeared to be pre-AD and nearly all converted to AD. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with MCI who were clinically similar showed substantial heterogeneity in biomarkers.},

abstract = {ContextThe ability to identify and quantify brain $\beta$-amyloid could increase the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.ObjectiveTo determine if florbetapir F 18 positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging performed during life accurately predicts the presence of $\beta$-amyloid in the brain at autopsy.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective clinical evaluation conducted February 2009 through March 2010 of florbetapir-PET imaging performed on 35 patients from hospice, long-term care, and community health care facilities near the end of their lives (6 patients to establish the protocol and 29 to validate) compared with immunohistochemistry and silver stain measures of brain $\beta$-amyloid after their death used as the reference standard. PET images were also obtained in 74 young individuals (18-50 years) presumed free of brain amyloid to better understand the frequency of a false-positive interpretation of a florbetapir-PET image.Main Outcome MeasuresCorrelation of florbetapir-PET image interpretation (based on the median of 3 nuclear medicine physicians' ratings) and semiautomated quantification of cortical retention with postmortem $\beta$-amyloid burden, neuritic amyloid plaque density, and neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease in the first 35 participants autopsied (out of 152 individuals enrolled in the PET pathological correlation study).ResultsFlorbetapir-PET imaging was performed a mean of 99 days (range, 1-377 days) before death for the 29 individuals in the primary analysis cohort. Fifteen of the 29 individuals (51.7{\%}) met pathological criteria for Alzheimer disease. Both visual interpretation of the florbetapir-PET images and mean quantitative estimates of cortical uptake were correlated with presence and quantity of $\beta$-amyloid pathology at autopsy as measured by immunohistochemistry (Bonferroni $\rho$, 0.78 [95{\%} confidence interval, 0.58-0.89]; P {\textless}.001]) and silver stain neuritic plaque score (Bonferroni $\rho$, 0.71 [95{\%} confidence interval, 0.47-0.86]; P {\textless}.001). Florbetapir-PET images and postmortem results rated as positive or negative for $\beta$-amyloid agreed in 96{\%} of the 29 individuals in the primary analysis cohort. The florbetapir-PET image was rated as amyloid negative in the 74 younger individuals in the nonautopsy cohort.ConclusionsFlorbetapir-PET imaging was correlated with the presence and density of $\beta$-amyloid. These data provide evidence that a molecular imaging procedure can identify $\beta$-amyloid pathology in the brains of individuals during life. Additional studies are required to understand the appropriate use of florbetapir-PET imaging in the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and for the prediction of progression to dementia.},

abstract = {The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by changes in personality and behaviour. It is typically associated with frontal lobe atrophy, although patterns of atrophy are heterogeneous. The objective of this study was to examine case-by-case variability in patterns of grey matter atrophy in subjects with the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia and to investigate whether behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia can be divided into distinct anatomical subtypes. Sixty-six subjects that fulfilled clinical criteria for a diagnosis of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia with a volumetric magnetic resonance imaging scan were identified. Grey matter volumes were obtained for 26 regions of interest, covering frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, striatum, insula and supplemental motor area, using the automated anatomical labelling atlas. Regional volumes were divided by total grey matter volume. A hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis using Ward's clustering linkage method was performed to cluster the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia subjects into different anatomical clusters. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess patterns of grey matter loss in each identified cluster of subjects compared to an age and gender-matched control group at P {\textless}0.05 (family-wise error corrected). We identified four potentially useful clusters with distinct patterns of grey matter loss, which we posit represent anatomical subtypes of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia. Two of these subtypes were associated with temporal lobe volume loss, with one subtype showing loss restricted to temporal lobe regions (temporal-dominant subtype) and the other showing grey matter loss in the temporal lobes as well as frontal and parietal lobes (temporofrontoparietal subtype). Another two subtypes were characterized by a large amount of frontal lobe volume loss, with one subtype showing grey matter loss in the frontal lobes as well as loss of the temporal lobes (frontotemporal subtype) and the other subtype showing loss relatively restricted to the frontal lobes (frontal-dominant subtype). These four subtypes differed on clinical measures of executive function, episodic memory and confrontation naming. There were also associations between the four subtypes and genetic or pathological diagnoses which were obtained in 48{\%} of the cohort. The clusters did not differ in behavioural severity as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory; supporting the original classification of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia in these subjects. Our findings suggest behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia can therefore be subdivided into four different anatomical subtypes.},

In the context of classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from healthy controls, we propose a method to incorporate subject meta-information into the manifold learning step.

In the proposed method, such information, whether discrete or continuous, can be used as an additional input to manifold learning and to enrich a distance measure derived from pairwise image similarities. Building on previous work, the Laplacian eigenmap objective function is extended to include the additional information. We use the ApoE genotype, the CSF-concentration of A$\beta$42 and hippocampal volume as meta-information to achieve significantly improved classification results for subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.},

abstract = {Peripheral biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) reflecting early neuropathological change are critical to the development of treatments for this condition. The most widely used indicator of AD pathology in life at present is neuroimaging evidence of brain atrophy. We therefore performed a proteomic analysis of plasma to derive biomarkers associated with brain atrophy in AD. Using gel based proteomics we previously identified seven plasma proteins that were significantly associated with hippocampal volume in a combined cohort of subjects with AD (N = 27) and MCI (N = 17). In the current report, we validated this finding in a large independent cohort of AD (N = 79), MCI (N = 88) and control (N = 95) subjects using alternative complementary methods-quantitative immunoassays for protein concentrations and estimation of pathology by whole brain volume. We confirmed that plasma concentrations of five proteins, together with age and sex, explained more than 35{\%} of variance in whole brain volume in AD patients. These proteins are complement components C3 and C3a, complement factor-I, $\gamma$-fibrinogen and alpha-1-microglobulin. Our findings suggest that these plasma proteins are strong predictors of in vivo AD pathology. Moreover, these proteins are involved in complement activation and coagulation, providing further evidence for an intrinsic role of these pathways in AD pathogenesis.},

Plasma concentration of amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$)—central in the pathogenesis of AD—is a logical candidate, but studies to date have produced conflicting results on its utility. Methods Plasma samples from 339 preclinical AD cases (76.4{\%} women, mean age 61.3 years) and 339 age- and sex-matched dementia-free controls, taken an average of 9.4 years before AD diagnosis, were analyzed using Luminex xMAP technology and INNO-BIA plasma A$\beta$ form assays to determine concentrations of free plasma A$\beta$40and A$\beta$42. Results Plasma concentrations of free A$\beta$40and A$\beta$42did not differ between preclinical AD cases and dementia-free controls, in the full sample or in subgroups defined according to sex and age group ({\textless}60 and ≥ 60 years). The interval between sampling and AD diagnosis did not affect the results. A$\beta$ concentrations did not change in the years preceding AD diagnosis among individuals for whom longitudinal samples were available. Discussion Plasma concentrations of free A$\beta$ could not predict the development of clinical AD, and A$\beta$ concentrations did not change in the years preceding AD diagnosis in this sample. These results indicate that free plasma A$\beta$ is not a useful biomarker for the identification of individuals at risk of developing clinical AD.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess pituitary gonadotropins and free testosterone levels in a larger cohort of men with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=112) and age-matched controls (n=98) from the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA). We measured gonadotropins (follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, and luteinizing hormone, LH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG, which determines the amount of free testosterone) and total testosterone (TT) using enzyme immunoassays. AD cases had significantly higher LH and FSH and lower free testosterone levels. LH, FSH and SHBG all increased with age, while free testosterone decreased. Low free testosterone was an independent predictor for AD. Its variance was overall explained by high SHBG, low TT, high LH, an older age and low body mass index (BMI). In controls, low thyroid stimulating hormone levels were also associated with low free testosterone. Elderly AD cases had raised levels of gonadotropins. This response may be an attempt to normalize low free testosterone levels. In non-demented participants, subclinical hyperthyroid disease (a risk factor for AD) which can result in higher SHBG levels, was associated with low free testosterone. Lowering SHBG and/or screening for subclinical thyroid disease may prevent cognitive decline and/or wasting in men at risk for AD. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The underlying genetic etiology of late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) remains largely unknown, likely due to its polygenic architecture and a lack of sophisticated analytic methods to evaluate complex genotype-phenotype models. The aim of the current study was to overcome these limitations in a bi-multivariate fashion by linking intermediate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phenotypes with a genome-wide sample of common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants. We compared associations between 94 different brain regions of interest derived from structural MRI scans and 533,872 genome-wide SNPs using a novel multivariate statistical procedure, parallel-independent component analysis, in a large, national multi-center subject cohort. The study included 209 elderly healthy controls, 367 subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 181 with mild, early-stage LOAD, all of them Caucasian adults, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Imaging was performed on comparable 1.5. T scanners at over 50 sites in the USA/Canada. Four primary "genetic components" were associated significantly with a single structural network including all regions involved neuropathologically in LOAD. Pathway analysis suggested that each component included several genes already known to contribute to LOAD risk (e.g. APOE4) or involved in pathologic processes contributing to the disorder, including inflammation, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. In addition significant novel genes identified included ZNF673, VPS13, SLC9A7, ATP5G2 and SHROOM2. Unlike conventional analyses, this multivariate approach identified distinct groups of genes that are plausibly linked in physiologic pathways, perhaps epistatically. Further, the study exemplifies the value of this novel approach to explore large-scale data sets involving high-dimensional gene and endophenotype data. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We present a new technique called " t-SNE " that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza-tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

abstract = {Alternative stress echocardiography protocols such as handgrip exercise are potentially more favorable towards large-scale screening scenarios than those currently adopted in clinical practice. However, these are still underexplored because the maximal exercise levels are not easily quantified and regulated, requiring the analysis of the complete data sequences (thousands of images), which represents a challenging task for the clinician. We propose a framework for the analysis of these complex datasets, and illustrate it on a handgrip exercise dataset including complete acquisitions of 10 healthy controls and 5 ANT1 mutation patients (1377 cardiac cycles). The framework is based on an unsupervised formulation of multiple kernel learning, which is used to integrate information coming from myocardial velocity traces and heart rate to obtain a lower-dimensional representation of the data. Such simplified representation is then explored to discriminate groups of response and understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

abstract = {We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series, building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) discrepancy. Unlike the Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW is a differentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regular-ization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines (Petitjean et al., 2011). Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense.},

The resulting data representations are typically high-dimensional and assume diverse forms. Hence, finding a way of transforming them into a unified space of lower dimension generally facilitates the underlying tasks such as object recognition or clustering. To this end, the proposed approach (termed MKL-DR) generalizes the framework of multiple kernel learning for dimensionality reduction, and distinguishes itself with the following three main contributions: First, our method provides the convenience of using diverse image descriptors to describe useful characteristics of various aspects about the underlying data. Second, it extends a broad set of existing dimensionality reduction techniques to consider multiple kernel learning, and consequently improves their effectiveness. Third, by focusing on the techniques pertaining to dimensionality reduction, the formulation introduces a new class of applications with the multiple kernel learning framework to address not only the supervised learning problems but also the unsupervised and semi-supervised ones. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

The method builds upon multiple kernel learning, a machine learning technique that allows the combination of data of different nature and the reduction of their dimensionality towards a meaningful representation (output space). The learning process is kept unsupervised, to study the variability of the input traces without being conditioned by data labels. To enhance the physiological interpretation of the output space, the variability that it encodes is analyzed in the space of input signals after reconstructing the velocity traces via multiscale kernel regression. The methodology was applied to 2D sequences from a stress echocardiography protocol from 55 subjects (22 healthy, 19 HFPEF and 14 breathless subjects). The results confirm that characterization of the myocardial functional response to stress in the HFPEF syndrome may be improved by the joint analysis of multiple relevant features.},

This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal $\beta$-amyloid deposition (A$\beta$+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than A$\beta$ deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A$\beta$ to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A$\beta$ pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A$\beta$ deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by “classic” AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers.

On the other hand, longitudinal studies, such as Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), collect phenotypic information at multiple time points. In this article, as a case study, we conducted both longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of the ADNI data with several brain imaging (not clinical diagnosis) phenotypes, demonstrating the power gains of longitudinal analysis over cross-sectional analysis. Specifically, we scanned genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 56 brain-wide imaging phenotypes processed by FreeSurfer on 638 subjects. At the genome-wide significance level P {\textless}1.8 x 10(9)) or a less stringent level (e.g. P {\textless}10(7)), longitudinal analysis of the phenotypic data from the baseline to month 48 identified more SNP-phenotype associations than cross-sectional analysis of only the baseline data. In particular, at the genome-wide significance level, both SNP rs429358 in gene APOE and SNP rs2075650 in gene TOMM40 were confirmed to be associated with various imaging phenotypes in multiple regions of interests (ROIs) by both analyses, though longitudinal analysis detected more regional phenotypes associated with the two SNPs and indicated another significant SNP rs439401 in gene APOE. In light of the power advantage of longitudinal analysis, we advocate its use in current and future longitudinal neuroimaging studies.},

abstract = {Hypothetical models of AD progression typically relate clinical stages of AD to sequential changes in CSF biomarkers, imaging, and cognition. However, quantifying the continuous trajectories proposed by these models over time is difficult because of the difficulty in relating the dynamics of different biomarkers during a clinical trial that is significantly shorter than the duration of the disease. We seek to show that through proper synchronization, it is possible to de-convolve these trends and quantify the periods of time associated with different pathophysiological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We developed a model that replicated the observed progression of ADAS-Cog 13 scores and used this as a more precise estimate of disease-duration and thus pathologic stage. We then synchronized cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging biomarkers according to our new disease timeline. By de-convolving disease progression via ADAS-Cog 13, we were able to confirm the predictions of previous hypothetical models of disease progression as well as establish concrete timelines for different pathobiological events. Specifically, our work supports a sequential pattern of biomarker changes in AD in which reduction in CSF A$\beta$(42) and brain atrophy precede the increases in CSF tau and phospho-tau.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brain functional connectivity network (BFCN) has been widely applied to identify biomarkers for the brain function understanding and brain diseases analysis. OBJECTIVE: Building a biologically meaningful brain network is a crucial work in these applications. For this task, sparse learning has been widely applied for the network construction. If multiple time-point data is added to the brain imaging application, the disease progression pattern in the longitudinal analysis can be better revealed. METHODS: A novel longitudinal analysis for MCI classification is devised based on resting-state functional magnetic resonating imaging (rs-fMRI). Specifically, this paper proposes a novel multi-task learning method to integrate fused penalty by regularization. In addition, a novel objective function is developed for fused sparse learning via smoothness constraint.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The biomarker model of Alzheimer's disease postulates a dynamic sequence of amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline as an individual progresses from preclinical Alzheimer's disease to dementia. Despite supportive evidence from cross-sectional studies, verification with long-term within-individual data is needed. METHODS: For this prospective cohort study, carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations (aged {\textgreater}/=21 years) were recruited from across the USA through referrals by physicians or from affected families. People with mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP were assessed at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center every 1-2 years, between March 23, 2003, and Aug 1, 2014. We measured global cerebral amyloid beta (Abeta) load using (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound-B PET, posterior cortical metabolism with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, hippocampal volume (age and sex corrected) with T1-weighted MRI, verbal memory with the ten-item Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word List Learning Delayed Recall Test, and general cognition with the Mini Mental State Examination. We estimated overall biomarker trajectories across estimated years from symptom onset using linear mixed models, and compared these estimates with cross-sectional data from cognitively normal control individuals (age 65-89 years) who were negative for amyloidosis, hypometabolism, and hippocampal atrophy. In the mutation carriers who had the longest follow-up, we examined the within-individual progression of amyloidosis, metabolism, hippocampal volume, and cognition to identify progressive within-individual changes (a significant change was defined as an increase or decrease of more than two Z scores standardised to controls). FINDINGS: 16 people with mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP, aged 28-56 years, completed between two and eight assessments (a total of 83 assessments) over 2-11 years. Significant differences in mutation carriers compared with controls (p{\textless}0.01) were detected in the following order: increased amyloidosis (7.5 years before expected onset), decreased metabolism (at time of expected onset), decreased hippocampal volume and verbal memory (7.5 years after expected onset), and decreased general cognition (10 years after expected onset). Among the seven participants with longest follow-up (seven or eight assessments spanning 6-11 years), three individuals had active amyloidosis without progressive neurodegeneration or cognitive decline, two amyloid-positive individuals showed progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline without further progressive amyloidosis, and two amyloid-positive individuals showed neither active amyloidosis nor progressive neurodegeneration or cognitive decline. INTERPRETATION: Our results support amyloidosis as the earliest component of the biomarker model in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Our within-individual examination suggests three sequential phases in the development of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease-active amyloidosis, a stable amyloid-positive period, and progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline-indicating that Abeta accumulation is largely complete before progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline occur. These findings offer supportive evidence for efforts to target early Abeta deposition for secondary prevention in individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.

abstract = {The heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases is a key confound to disease understanding and treatment development, as study cohorts typically include multiple phenotypes on distinct disease trajectories. Here we introduce a machine-learning technique-Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn)-able to uncover data-driven disease phenotypes with distinct temporal progression patterns, from widely available cross-sectional patient studies. Results from imaging studies in two neurodegenerative diseases reveal subgroups and their distinct trajectories of regional neurodegeneration. In genetic frontotemporal dementia, SuStaIn identifies genotypes from imaging alone, validating its ability to identify subtypes; further the technique reveals within-genotype heterogeneity. In Alzheimer's disease, SuStaIn uncovers three subtypes, uniquely characterising their temporal complexity. SuStaIn provides fine-grained patient stratification, which substantially enhances the ability to predict conversion between diagnostic categories over standard models that ignore subtype (p = 7.18 × 10 −4) or temporal stage (p = 3.96 × 10 −5). SuStaIn offers new promise for enabling disease subtype discovery and precision medicine.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the use of a probabilistic generative model to explore the biomarker changes occurring as Alzheimer's disease develops and progresses. We enhanced the recently introduced event-based model for use with a multi-modal sporadic disease data set. This allows us to determine the sequence in which Alzheimer's disease biomarkers become abnormal without reliance on a priori clinical diagnostic information or explicit biomarker cut points. The model also characterizes the uncertainty in the ordering and provides a natural patient staging system. Two hundred and eighty-five subjects (92 cognitively normal, 129 mild cognitive impairment, 64 Alzheimer's disease) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with measurements of 14 Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, regional magnetic resonance imaging brain volume and rates of atrophy measures, and cognitive test scores. We used the event-based model to determine the sequence of biomarker abnormality and its uncertainty in various population subgroups. We used patient stages assigned by the event-based model to discriminate cognitively normal subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, and predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment. The model predicts that cerebrospinal fluid levels become abnormal first, followed by rates of atrophy, then cognitive test scores, and finally regional brain volumes. In amyloid-positive (cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta1-42 {\textless}192 pg/ml) or APOE-positive (one or more APOE4 alleles) subjects, the model predicts with high confidence that the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers become abnormal in a distinct sequence: amyloid-beta1-42, phosphorylated tau, total tau. However, in the broader population total tau and phosphorylated tau are found to be earlier cerebrospinal fluid markers than amyloid-beta1-42, albeit with more uncertainty. The model's staging system strongly separates cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease subjects (maximum classification accuracy of 99{\%}), and predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (maximum balanced accuracy of 77{\%} over 3 years), and from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (maximum balanced accuracy of 76{\%} over 5 years). By fitting Cox proportional hazards models, we find that baseline model stage is a significant risk factor for conversion from both mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (P = 2.06 x 10(-7)) and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (P = 0.033). The data-driven model we describe supports hypothetical models of biomarker ordering in amyloid-positive and APOE-positive subjects, but suggests that biomarker ordering in the wider population may diverge from this sequence. The model provides useful disease staging information across the full spectrum of disease progression, from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. This approach has broad application across neurodegenerative disease, providing insights into disease biology, as well as staging and prognostication.},

abstract = {Abstract Accurately identifying the patients that have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will go on to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) will become essential as new treatments will require identification of AD patients at earlier stages in the disease process. Most previous work in this area has centred around the same automated techniques used to diagnose AD patients from healthy controls, by coupling high dimensional brain image data or other relevant biomarker data to modern machine learning techniques. Such studies can now distinguish between AD patients and controls as accurately as an experienced clinician. Models trained on patients with AD and control subjects can also distinguish between MCI patients that will convert to AD within a given timeframe (MCI-c) and those that remain stable (MCI-s), although differences between these groups are smaller and thus, the corresponding accuracy is lower. The most common type of classifier used in these studies is the support vector machine, which gives categorical class decisions. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian process (GP) classification to the problem. This fully Bayesian method produces naturally probabilistic predictions, which we show correlate well with the actual chances of converting to AD within 3 years in a population of 96 MCI-s and 47 MCI-c subjects. Furthermore, we show that GPs can integrate multimodal data (in this study volumetric MRI, FDG-PET, cerebrospinal fluid, and APOE genotype with the classification process through the use of a mixed kernel). The GP approach aids combination of different data sources by learning parameters automatically from training data via type-II maximum likelihood, which we compare to a more conventional method based on cross validation and an SVM classifier. When the resulting probabilities from the GP are dichotomised to produce a binary classification, the results for predicting MCI conversion based on the combination of all three types of data show a balanced accuracy of 74{\%}. This is a substantially higher accuracy than could be obtained using any individual modality or using a multikernel SVM, and is competitive with the highest accuracy yet achieved for predicting conversion within three years on the widely used ADNI dataset.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of clinical changes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, including both qualitative change (i.e., conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD)) and quantitative change (i.e., cognitive scores) at future time points, is important for early diagnosis of AD and for monitoring the disease progression. In this paper, we propose to predict future clinical changes of MCI patients by using both baseline and longitudinal multimodality data. To do this, we first develop a longitudinal feature selection method to jointly select brain regions across multiple time points for each modality. Specifically, for each time point, we train a sparse linear regression model by using the imaging data and the corresponding clinical scores, with an extra 'group regularization' to group the weights corresponding to the same brain region across multiple time points together and to allow for selection of brain regions based on the strength of multiple time points jointly. Then, to further reflect the longitudinal changes on the selected brain regions, we extract a set of longitudinal features from the original baseline and longitudinal data. Finally, we combine all features on the selected brain regions, from different modalities, for prediction by using our previously proposed multi-kernel SVM. We validate our method on 88 ADNI MCI subjects, with both MRI and FDG-PET data and the corresponding clinical scores (i.e., MMSE and ADAS-Cog) at 5 different time points. We first predict the clinical scores (MMSE and ADAS-Cog) at 24-month by using the multimodality data at previous time points, and then predict the conversion of MCI to AD by using the multimodality data at time points which are at least 6-month ahead of the conversion. The results on both sets of experiments show that our proposed method can achieve better performance in predicting future clinical changes of MCI patients than the conventional methods.},

abstract = {Many machine learning and pattern classification methods have been applied to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recently, rather than predicting categorical variables as in classification, several pattern regression methods have also been used to estimate continuous clinical variables from brain images. However, most existing regression methods focus on estimating multiple clinical variables separately and thus cannot utilize the intrinsic useful correlation information among different clinical variables. On the other hand, in those regression methods, only a single modality of data (usually only the structural MRI) is often used, without considering the complementary information that can be provided by different modalities. In this paper, we propose a general methodology, namely multi-modal multi-task (M3T) learning, to jointly predict multiple variables from multi-modal data. Here, the variables include not only the clinical variables used for regression but also the categorical variable used for classification, with different tasks corresponding to prediction of different variables. Specifically, our method contains two key components, i.e., (1) a multi-task feature selection which selects the common subset of relevant features for multiple variables from each modality, and (2) a multi-modal support vector machine which fuses the above-selected features from all modalities to predict multiple (regression and classification) variables. To validate our method, we perform two sets of experiments on ADNI baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data from 45 AD patients, 91 MCI patients, and 50 healthy controls (HC). In the first set of experiments, we estimate two clinical variables such as Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), as well as one categorical variable (with value of ‘AD', ‘MCI' or ‘HC'), from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. In the second set of experiments, we predict the 2-year changes of MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores and also the conversion of MCI to AD from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. The results on both sets of experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3T learning scheme can achieve better performance on both regression and classification tasks than the conventional learning methods.},

abstract = {Algorithmic image-based diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases on longitudinal data has drawn great interest from computer vision researchers. The current state-of-the-art models for many image classification tasks are based on the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, a key challenge in applying CNN to biological problems is that the available labeled training samples are very limited. Another issue for CNN to be applied in computer aided diagnosis applications is that to achieve better diagnosis and prognosis accuracy, one usually has to deal with the longitudinal dataset, i.e., the dataset of images scanned at different time points. Here we argue that an enhanced CNN model with transfer learning for the joint analysis of tasks from multiple time points or regions of interests may have a potential to improve the accuracy of computer aided diagnosis. To reach this goal, we innovate a CNN based deep learning multi-task dictionary learning framework to address the above challenges. Firstly, we pre-train CNN on the ImageNet dataset and transfer the knowledge from the pre-trained model to the medical imaging progression representation, generating the features for different tasks. Then, we propose a novel unsupervised learning method, termed Multi-task Stochastic Coordinate Coding (MSCC), for learning different tasks by using shared and individual dictionaries and generating the sparse features required to predict the future cognitive clinical scores. We apply our new model in a publicly available neuroimaging cohort to predict clinical measures with two different feature sets and compare them with seven other state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show our proposed method achieved superior results.},

abstract = {Longitudinal neuroimaging studies are becoming increasingly prevalent, where brain images are collected on multiple subjects at multiple time points. Analyses of such data are scientifically important, but also challenging. Brain images are in the form of multidimensional arrays, or tensors, which are characterized by both ultrahigh dimensionality and a complex structure. Longitudinally repeated images and induced temporal correlations add a further layer of complexity. Despite some recent efforts, there exist very few solutions for longitudinal imaging analyses. In response to the increasing need to analyze longitudinal imaging data, we propose several tensor generalized estimating equations (GEEs). The proposed GEE ap- proach accounts for intra-subject correlation, and an imposed low-rank structure on the coefficient tensor effectively reduces the dimensionality. We also propose a scalable estimation algorithm, establish the asymptotic properties of the solu- tion to the tensor GEEs, and investigate sparsity regularization for the purpose of region selection. We demonstrate the proposed method using simulations and by analyzing a real data set from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a severe neurodegenerative disorder. Identifying biomarkers that can track the progress of the disease has recently received increasing attentions in AD research. An accurate prediction of disease progression would facilitate optimal decision-making for clinicians and patients. A definitive diagnosis of AD requires autopsy confirmation, thus many clinical/cognitive measures including Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) have been designed to evaluate the cognitive status of the patients and used as important criteria for clinical diagnosis of probable AD. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting disease progression measured by the cognitive scores and selecting biomarkers predictive of the progression. Specifically, we formulate the prediction problem as a multi-task regression problem by considering the prediction at each time point as a task and propose two novel multi-task learning formulations. We have performed extensive experiments using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Specifically, we use the baseline MRI features to predict MMSE/ADAS-Cog scores in the next 4. years. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-task learning formulations for disease progression in comparison with single-task learning algorithms including ridge regression and Lasso. We also perform longitudinal stability selection to identify and analyze the temporal patterns of biomarkers in disease progression. We observe that cortical thickness average of left middle temporal, cortical thickness average of left and right Entorhinal, and white matter volume of left Hippocampus play significant roles in predicting ADAS-Cog at all time points. We also observe that several MRI biomarkers provide significant information for predicting MMSE scores for the first 2. years, however very few are shown to be significant in predicting MMSE score at later stages. The lack of predictable MRI biomarkers in later stages may contribute to the lower prediction performance of MMSE than that of ADAS-Cog in our study and other related studies. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract Recent studies on AD/MCI diagnosis have shown that the tasks of identifying brain disease and predicting clinical scores are highly related to each other. Furthermore, it has been shown that feature selection with a manifold learning or a sparse model can handle the problems of high feature dimensionality and small sample size. However, the tasks of clinical score regression and clinical label classification were often conducted separately in the previous studies. Regarding the feature selection, to our best knowledge, most of the previous work considered a loss function defined as an element-wise difference between the target values and the predicted ones. In this paper, we consider the problems of joint regression and classification for AD/MCI diagnosis and propose a novel matrix-similarity based loss function that uses high-level information inherent in the target response matrix and imposes the information to be preserved in the predicted response matrix. The newly devised loss function is combined with a group lasso method for joint feature selection across tasks, i.e., predictions of clinical scores and a class label. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and showed that the newly devised loss function helped enhance the performances of both clinical score prediction and disease status identification, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {In this work, we consider the problem of predicting the course of a progressive disease, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Progressive diseases often start with mild symptoms that might precede a diagnosis, and each patient follows their own trajectory. Patient trajectories exhibit wild variability, which can be associated with many factors such as genotype, age, or sex. An additional layer of complexity is that, in real life, the amount and type of data available for each patient can differ significantly. For example, for one patient we might have no prior history, whereas for another patient we might have detailed clinical assessments obtained at multiple prior time-points. This paper presents a probabilistic model that can handle multiple modalities (including images and clinical assessments) and variable patient histories with irregular timings and missing entries, to predict clinical scores at future time-points. We use a sigmoidal function to model latent disease progression, which gives rise to clinical observations in our generative model. We implemented an approximate Bayesian inference strategy on the proposed model to estimate the parameters on data from a large population of subjects. Furthermore, the Bayesian framework enables the model to automatically fine-tune its predictions based on historical observations that might be available on the test subject. We applied our method to a longitudinal Alzheimer's disease dataset with more than 3000 subjects [23] and present a detailed empirical analysis of prediction performance under different scenarios, with comparisons against several benchmarks. We also demonstrate how the proposed model can be interrogated to glean insights about temporal dynamics in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from neuroimaging data at the pre-clinical stage has been intensively investigated because of the immense social and economic cost. In the past decade, computational approaches on longitudinal image sequences have been actively investigated with special attention to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which is an intermediate stage between normal control (NC) and AD. However, current state-of-the-art diagnosis methods have limited power in clinical practice, due to the excessive requirements such as equal and immoderate number of scans in longitudinal imaging data. More critically, very few methods are specifically designed for the early alarm of AD uptake. To address these limitations, we propose a flexible spatial-temporal solution for early detection of AD by recognizing abnormal structure changes from longitudinal MR image sequence. Specifically, our method is leveraged by the non-reversible nature of AD progression. We employ temporally structured SVM to accurately alarm AD at early stage by enforcing the monotony on classification result to avoid unrealistic and inconsistent diagnosis result along time. Furthermore, in order to select best features which can well collaborate with the classifier, we present as joint feature selection and classification framework. The evaluation on more than 150 longitudinal subjects from ADNI dataset shows that our method is able to alarm the conversion of AD 12 months prior to the clinical diagnosis with at least 82.5 {\%} accuracy. It is worth noting that our proposed method works on widely used MR images and does not have restriction on the number of scans in the longitudinal sequence, which is very attractive to real clinical practice.},

Our approach to developmental and aging longitudinal studies characterizes heterogeneous structural growth/decline between and within groups. In particular, we propose a probabilistic generative model that parameterizes individual and ensemble average changes in brain structure using linear mixed-effects models of age and subject-specific covariates. Model inversion uses Expectation Maximization (EM), while voxelwise (empirical) priors on the size of individual differences are estimated from the data. Bayesian inference on individual and group trajectories is realized using Posterior Probability Maps (PPM). In addition to parameter inference, the framework affords comparisons of models with varying combinations of model order for fixed and random effects using model evidence. We validate the model in simulations and real MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. We further demonstrate how subject specific characteristics contribute to individual differences in longitudinal volume changes in healthy subjects, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2014. We develop a flexible framework for modeling high-dimensional imaging data observed longitudinally. The approach decomposes the observed variability of repeatedly measured high-dimensional observations into three additive components: a subject-specific imaging random intercept that quantifies the cross-sectional variability, a subject-specific imaging slope that quantifies the dynamic irreversible deformation over multiple realizations, and a subject-visit-specific imaging deviation that quantifies exchangeable effects between visits. The proposed method is very fast, scalable to studies including ultrahigh-dimensional data, and can easily be adapted to and executed on modest computing infrastructures. The method is applied to the longitudinal analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of the corpus callosum of multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects. The study includes 176 subjects observed at 466 visits. For each subject and visit the study contains a registered DTI scan of the corpus callosum at roughly 30,000 voxels.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The dose-dependent impact of this allele on hippocampal volumes has been documented, but its influence on general hippocampal morphology in cognitively unimpaired individuals is still elusive. Capitalizing on the study of a large number of cognitively unimpaired late middle aged and older adults with two, one and no APOE-e4 alleles, the current study aims to characterize the ability of our automated surface-based hippocampal morphometry algorithm to distinguish between these three levels of genetic risk for AD and demonstrate its superiority to a commonly used hippocampal volume measurement. We examined the APOE-e4 dose effect on cross-sectional hippocampal morphology analysis in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) database of 117 cognitively unimpaired subjects aged between 50 and 85 years (mean = 57.4, SD = 6.3), including 36 heterozygotes (e3/e4), 37 homozygotes (e4/e4) and 44 non-carriers (e3/e3). The proposed automated framework includes hippocampal surface segmentation and reconstruction, higher-order hippocampal surface correspondence computation, and hippocampal surface deformation analysis with multivariate statistics. In our experiments, the surface-based method identified APOE-e4 dose effects on the left hippocampal morphology. Compared to the widely-used hippocampal volume measure, our hippocampal morphometry statistics showed greater statistical power by distinguishing cognitively unimpaired subjects with two, one, and no APOE-e4 alleles. Our findings mirrored previous studies showing that APOE-e4 has a dose effect on the acceleration of brain structure deformities. The results indicated that the proposed surface-based hippocampal morphometry measure is a potential preclinical AD imaging biomarker for cognitively unimpaired individuals.},

We assessed the effects of these risk factors on gray matter (GM) volume in 295 cognitively healthy middle-aged community-dwelling subjects. Voxel-based morphometry was used to study GM volume differences between high- and low-risk subjects, based on APOE4 carriership (n = 74), first-degree FH (n = 228), or both (n = 62). No significant results were found using a corrected p value. Using a more lenient threshold (p {\textless}0.001 and minimum cluster size of 100 voxels), APOE4 carriers had reduced GM in the striatum compared to noncarriers. Subjects with FH had reduced GM in right precuneus compared to subjects without FH. Maternal and paternal FH provided similar atrophy patterns. APOE4 carriers with FH had GM reductions in bilateral insula compared to subjects with neither APOE4 nor FH. We conclude that a family history of dementia and APOE4 carriership are both associated with regional GM decreases in cognitively healthy middle-aged subjects, with differential effects on brain regions typically affected in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (APOE) dependent lifetime risks (LTRs) for Alzheimer Disease (AD) are currently not accurately known and odds ratios alone are insufficient to assess these risks. We calculated AD LTR in 7351 cases and 10 132 controls from Caucasian ancestry using Rochester (USA) incidence data. At the age of 85 the LTR of AD without reference to APOE genotype was 11{\%} in males and 14{\%} in females. At the same age, this risk ranged from 51{\%} for APOE44 male carriers to 60{\%} for APOE44 female carriers, and from 23{\%} for APOE34 male carriers to 30{\%} for APOE34 female carriers, consistent with semi-dominant inheritance of a moderately penetrant gene. Using PAQUID (France) incidence data, estimates were globally similar except that at age 85 the LTRs reached 68 and 35{\%} for APOE 44 and APOE 34 female carriers, respectively. These risks are more similar to those of major genes in Mendelian diseases, such as BRCA1 in breast cancer, than those of low-risk common alleles identified by recent GWAS in complex diseases. In addition, stratification of our data by age groups clearly demonstrates that APOE4 is a risk factor not only for late-onset but for early-onset AD as well. Together, these results urge a reappraisal of the impact of APOE in Alzheimer disease. {\textcopyright}2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Functions of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) core fall into three categories: (1) those of the central MRI core laboratory at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, needed to generate high quality MRI data in all subjects at each time point; (2) those of the funded ADNI MRI core imaging analysis groups responsible for analyzing the MRI data; and (3) the joint function of the entire MRI core in designing and problem solving MR image acquisition, pre-processing, and analyses methods. The primary objective of ADNI was and continues to be improving methods for clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease. Our approach to the present ("ADNI- GO") and future ("ADNI-2," if funded) MRI protocol will be to maintain MRI methodological consistency in the previously enrolled "ADNI-1" subjects who are followed up longitudinally in ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. We will modernize and expand the MRI protocol for all newly enrolled ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 subjects. All newly enrolled subjects will be scanned at 3T with a core set of three sequence types: 3D T1-weighted volume, FLAIR, and a long TE gradient echo volumetric acquisition for micro hemorrhage detection. In addition to this core ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 protocol, we will perform vendor-specific pilot sub-studies of arterial spin-labeling perfusion, resting state functional connectivity, and diffusion tensor imaging. One of these sequences will be added to the core protocol on systems from each MRI vendor. These experimental sub-studies are designed to demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring useful data in a multicenter (but single vendor) setting for these three emerging MRI applications. {\textcopyright}2010 The Alzheimer's Association.

abstract = {The $\zeta$4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but limited work has suggested that APOE genotype may modulate disease phenotype. Carriers of the $\zeta$4 allele have been reported to have greater medial temporal lobe (MTL) pathology and poorer memory than noncarriers. Less attention has focused on whether there are domains of cognition and neuroanatomical regions more affected in noncarriers. Further, a major potential confound of prior in vivo studies is the possibility of different rates of clinical misdiagnosis for carriers vs. noncarriers. We compared phenotypic differences in cognition and topography of regional cortical atrophy of $\zeta$4 carriers (n = 67) vs. noncarriers (n = 24) with mild AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, restricted to those with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) molecular profile consistent with AD. Between-group comparisons were made for psychometric tests and morphometric measures of cortical thickness and hippocampal volume. Carriers displayed significantly greater impairment on measures of memory retention, whereas noncarriers were more impaired on tests of working memory, executive control, and lexical access. Consistent with this cognitive dissociation, carriers exhibited greater MTL atrophy, whereas noncarriers had greater frontoparietal atrophy. Performance deficits in particular cognitive domains were associated with disproportionate regional brain atrophy within nodes of cortical networks thought to subserve these cognitive processes. These convergent cognitive and neuroanatomic findings in individuals with a CSF molecular profile consistent with AD support the hypothesis that APOE genotype modulates the clinical phenotype of AD through influence on specific large-scale brain networks.},

abstract = {Research on apolipoprotein E (APOE) has consistently revealed a relationship between the gene's $\epsilon$4 allele and risk for development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, research with younger populations of $\epsilon$4 carriers has suggested that the APOE $\epsilon$4 allele may in fact be beneficial in earlier ages and may only confer risk of cognitive decline later in life. Accordingly, we and others have proposed that APOE may represent an example of antagonistic pleiotropy. Antagonistic pleiotropy is an evolutionary biology concept that proposes certain genes or alleles that may differentially impact fitness during different life stages. We critically review this hypothesis in light of new research of the impact of APOE on cognition and neural integrity across the lifespan. We provide recommendations for the revision of the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis of APOE and suggest important avenues for future research in this area.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is a specific dose-dependent effect of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$4 and $\epsilon$2 alleles on hippocampal volume, across the cognitive spectrum, from normal aging to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed MR and genetic data on 662 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database-198 cognitively normal controls (CN), 321 mild-cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and 143 AD subjects-looking for dose-dependent effects of the $\epsilon$4 and $\epsilon$2 alleles on hippocampal volumes. Volumes were measured using a fully-automated algorithm applied to high resolution T1-weighted MR images. Statistical analysis consisted of a multivariate regression with repeated-measures model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There was a dose-dependent effect of the $\epsilon$4 allele on hippocampal volume in AD (p = 0.04) and MCI (p = 0.02)-in both cases, each allele accounted for loss of {\textgreater}150 mm(3) (approximately 4{\%}) of hippocampal volume below the mean volume for AD and MCI subjects with no such alleles (Cohen's d = -0.16 and -0.19 for AD and MCI, respectively). There was also a dose-dependent, main effect of the $\epsilon$2 allele (p{\textless}0.0001), suggestive of a moderate protective effect on hippocampal volume-an approximately 20{\%} per allele volume increase as compared to CN with no $\epsilon$2 alleles (Cohen's d = 0.23).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Though no effect of $\epsilon$4 was seen in CN subjects, our findings confirm and extend prior data on the opposing effects of the APOE $\epsilon$4 and $\epsilon$2 alleles on hippocampal morphology across the spectrum of cognitive aging.},

abstract = {To determine the prevalence of early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) and of autosomal dominant forms of EOAD (ADEOAD), we performed a population-based study in the city of Rouen (426,710 residents). EOAD was defined as onset of disease at age {\textless}61 years, and ADEOAD was defined as the occurrence of at least three EOAD cases in three generations. Using these stringent criteria, we calculated that the EOAD and ADEOAD prevalences per 100,000 persons at risk were 41.2 and 5.3, respectively. We then performed a mutational analysis of the genes for amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) in 34 families with ADEOAD ascertained in France. In 19 (56{\%}) of these families, we identified 16 distinct PSEN1 missense mutations, including 4 (Thr147Ile, Trp165Cys, Leu173Trp, and Ser390Ile) not reported elsewhere. APP mutations, including a novel mutation located at codon 715, were identified in 5 (15{\%}) of the families. In the 10 remaining ADEOAD families and in 9 additional autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease families that did not fulfill the strict criteria for ADEOAD, no PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP mutation was identified. These results show that (1) PSEN1 and APP mutations account for 71{\%} of ADEOAD families and (2) nonpenetrance at age {\textless}61 years is probably infrequent for PSEN1 or APP mutations.},

@article{Huang2020,
abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) accounts for 60-70{\%} of dementia cases. Given the seriousness of the disease and continual increase in patient numbers, developing effective therapies to treat AD has become urgent. Presently, the drugs available for AD treatment, including cholinesterase inhibitors and an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, can only inhibit dementia symptoms for a limited period of time but cannot stop or reverse disease progression. On the basis of the amyloid hypothesis, many global drug companies have conducted many clinical trials on amyloid clearing therapy but without success. Thus, the amyloid hypothesis may not be completely feasible. The number of anti-amyloid trials decreased in 2019, which might be a turning point. An in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the contribution of amyloid beta and other factors of AD is crucial for developing novel pharmacotherapies. In ongoing clinical trials, researchers have developed and are testing several possible interventions aimed at various targets, including anti-amyloid and anti-tau interventions, neurotransmitter modification, anti-neuroinflammation and neuroprotection interventions, and cognitive enhancement, and interventions to relieve behavioral psychological symptoms. In this article, we present the current state of clinical trials for AD at clinicaltrials.gov. We reviewed the underlying mechanisms of these trials, tried to understand the reason why prior clinical trials failed, and analyzed the future trend of AD clinical trials.},

abstract = {Background The causes of phenotypic heterogeneity in familial Alzheimer's disease with autosomal dominant inheritance are not well understood. We aimed to characterise clinical phenotypes and genetic associations with APP and PSEN1 mutations in symptomatic autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). Methods We retrospectively analysed genotypic and phenotypic data (age at symptom onset, initial cognitive or behavioural symptoms, and presence of myoclonus, seizures, pyramidal signs, extrapyramidal signs, and cerebellar signs) from all individuals with ADAD due to APP or PSEN1 mutations seen at the Dementia Research Centre in London, UK. We examined the frequency of presenting symptoms and additional neurological features, investigated associations with age at symptom onset, APOE genotype, and mutation position, and explored phenotypic differences between APP and PSEN1 mutation carriers. The proportion of individuals presenting with various symptoms was analysed with descriptive statistics, stratified by mutation type. Findings Between July 1, 1987, and Oct 31, 2015, age at onset was recorded for 213 patients (168 with PSEN1 mutations and 45 with APP mutations), with detailed history and neurological examination findings available for 121 (85 with PSEN1 mutations and 36 with APP mutations). We identified 38 different PSEN1 mutations (four novel) and six APP mutations (one novel). Age at onset differed by mutation, with a younger onset for individuals with PSEN1 mutations than for those with APP mutations (mean age 43{\textperiodcentered}6 years [SD 7{\textperiodcentered}2] vs 50{\textperiodcentered}4 years [SD 5{\textperiodcentered}2], respectively, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001); within the PSEN1 group, 72{\%} of age at onset variance was explained by the specific mutation. A cluster of five mutations with particularly early onset (mean age at onset {\textless}40 years) involving PSEN1's first hydrophilic loop suggests critical functional importance of this region. 71 (84{\%}) individuals with PSEN1 mutations and 35 (97{\%}) with APP mutations presented with amnestic symptoms, making atypical cognitive presentations significantly more common in PSEN1 mutation carriers (n=14; p=0{\textperiodcentered}037). Myoclonus and seizures were the most common additional neurological features; individuals with myoclonus (40 [47{\%}] with PSEN1 mutations and 12 [33{\%}] with APP mutations) were significantly more likely to develop seizures (p=0{\textperiodcentered}001 for PSEN1; p=0{\textperiodcentered}036 for APP), which affected around a quarter of the patients in each group (20 [24{\%}] and nine [25{\%}], respectively). A number of patients with PSEN1 mutations had pyramidal (21 [25{\%}]), extrapyramidal (12 [14{\%}]), or cerebellar (three [4{\%}]) signs. Interpretation ADAD phenotypes are heterogeneous, with both age at onset and clinical features being influenced by mutation position as well as causative gene. This highlights the importance of considering genetic testing in young patients with dementia and additional neurological features in order to appropriately diagnose and treat their symptoms, and of examining different mutation types separately in future research.

abstract = {Whilst cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers for amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) and tau pathologies are accurate for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), their broad implementation in clinical and trial settings are restricted by high cost and limited accessibility. Plasma phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181) is a promising blood-based biomarker that is specific for AD, correlates with cerebral A$\beta$ and tau pathology, and predicts future cognitive decline. In this study, we report the performance of p-tau181 in {\textgreater}1000 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia patients characterized by A$\beta$ PET. We confirmed that plasma p-tau181 is increased at the preclinical stage of Alzheimer and further increases in MCI and AD dementia. Individuals clinically classified as AD dementia but having negative A$\beta$ PET scans show little increase but plasma p-tau181 is increased if CSF A$\beta$ has already changed prior to A$\beta$ PET changes. Despite being a multicenter study, plasma p-tau181 demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy to identify AD dementia (AUC = 85.3{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 81.4–89.2{\%}), as well as to distinguish between A$\beta$− and A$\beta$+ individuals along the Alzheimer's continuum (AUC = 76.9{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 74.0–79.8{\%}). Higher baseline concentrations of plasma p-tau181 accurately predicted future dementia and performed comparably to the baseline prediction of CSF p-tau181. Longitudinal measurements of plasma p-tau181 revealed low intra-individual variability, which could be of potential benefit in disease-modifying trials seeking a measurable response to a therapeutic target. This study adds significant weight to the growing body of evidence in the use of plasma p-tau181 as a non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic tool for AD, regardless of clinical stage, which would be of great benefit in clinical practice and a large cost-saving in clinical trial recruitment.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is biologically heterogeneous, and detailed understanding of the processes involved in patients is critical for development of treatments. CSF contains hundreds of proteins, with concentrations reflecting ongoing (patho)physiological processes. This provides the opportunity to study many biological processes at the same time in patients. We studied whether Alzheimer's disease biological subtypes can be detected in CSF proteomics using the dual clustering technique non-negative matrix factorization. In two independent cohorts (EMIF-AD MBD and ADNI) we found that 705 (77{\%} of 911 tested) proteins differed between Alzheimer's disease (defined as having abnormal amyloid, n = 425) and controls (defined as having normal CSF amyloid and tau and normal cognition, n = 127). Using these proteins for data-driven clustering, we identified three robust pathophysiological Alzheimer's disease subtypes within each cohort showing (i) hyperplasticity and increased BACE1 levels; (ii) innate immune activation; and (iii) blood–brain barrier dysfunction with low BACE1 levels. In both cohorts, the majority of individuals were labelled as having subtype 1 (80, 36{\%} in EMIF-AD MBD; 117, 59{\%} in ADNI), 71 (32{\%}) in EMIF-AD MBD and 41 (21{\%}) in ADNI were labelled as subtype 2, and 72 (32{\%}) in EMIF-AD MBD and 39 (20{\%}) individuals in ADNI were labelled as subtype 3. Genetic analyses showed that all subtypes had an excess of genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (all P {\textgreater} 0.01). Additional pathological comparisons that were available for a subset in ADNI suggested that subtypes showed similar severity of Alzheimer's disease pathology, and did not differ in the frequencies of co-pathologies, providing further support that found subtypes truly reflect Alzheimer's disease heterogeneity. Compared to controls, all non-demented Alzheimer's disease individuals had increased risk of showing clinical progression (all P {\textless} 0.01). Compared to subtype 1, subtype 2 showed faster clinical progression after correcting for age, sex, level of education and tau levels (hazard ratio = 2.5; 95{\%} confidence interval = 1.2, 5.1; P = 0.01), and subtype 3 at trend level (hazard ratio = 2.1; 95{\%} confidence interval = 1.0, 4.4; P = 0.06).

@article{Lam2013,
abstract = {With increasing knowledge of clinical in vivo biomarkers and the pathological intricacies of Alzheimer's disease (AD), nosology is evolving. Harmonized consensus criteria that emphasize prototypic illness continue to develop to achieve diagnostic clarity for treatment decisions and clinical trials. However, it is clear that AD is clinically heterogeneous in presentation and progression, demonstrating variable topographic distributions of atrophy and hypometabolism/hypoperfusion. AD furthermore often keeps company with other conditions that may further nuance clinical expression, such as synucleinopathy exacerbating executive and visuospatial dysfunction and vascular pathologies (particularly small vessel disease that is increasingly ubiquitous with human aging) accentuating frontal-dysexecutive symptomatology. That some of these atypical clinical patterns recur may imply the existence of distinct AD variants. For example, focal temporal lobe dysfunction is associated with a pure amnestic syndrome, very slow decline, with atrophy and neurofibrillary tangles limited largely to the medial temporal region including the entorhinal cortex. Left parietal atrophy and/or hypometabolism/hypoperfusion are associated with language symptoms, younger age of onset, and faster rate of decline - a potential 'language variant' of AD. Conversely, the same pattern but predominantly affecting the right parietal lobe is associated with a similar syndrome but with visuospatial symptoms replacing impaired language function. Finally, the extremely rare frontal variant is associated with executive dysfunction out of keeping with degree of memory decline and may have prominent behavioural symptoms. Genotypic differences may underlie some of these subtypes; for example, absence of apolipoprotein E e4 is often associated with atypicality in younger onset AD. Understanding the mechanisms behind this variability merits further investigation, informed by recent advances in imaging techniques, biomarker assays, and quantitative pathological methods, in conjunction with standardized clinical, functional, neuropsychological and neurobehavioral evaluations. Such an understanding is needed to facilitate 'personalized AD medicine', and eventually allow for clinical trials targeting specific AD subtypes. Although the focus legitimately remains on prototypic illness, continuing efforts to develop disease-modifying therapies should not exclude the rarer AD subtypes and common comorbid presentations, as is currently often the case. Only by treating them as well can we address the full burden of this devastating dementia syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2013 BioMed Central Ltd.},

We investigated AD heterogeneity based on cortical and subcortical atrophy patterns in 299 AD subjects from 2 multicenter cohorts. Clusters of patients and important discriminative features were determined using random forest pairwise similarity, multidimensional scaling, and distance-based hierarchical clustering. We discovered 2 typical (72.2{\%}) and 3 atypical (28.8{\%}) subtypes with significantly different demographic, clinical, and cognitive characteristics, and different rates of cognitive decline. In contrast to previous studies, our unsupervised random forest approach based on cortical and subcortical volume measures and their linear and nonlinear interactions revealed more typical AD subtypes with important anatomically discriminative features, while the prevalence of atypical cases was lower. The hippocampal-sparing and typical AD subtypes exhibited worse clinical progression in visuospatial, memory, and executive cognitive functions. Our findings suggest there is substantial heterogeneity in AD that has an impact on how patients function and progress over time.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is one of the most affected areas in Alzheimer's disease (AD)1. Moreover, this structure hosts one of the most unique phenomena of the adult mammalian brain, namely, the addition of new neurons throughout life2. This process, called adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), confers an unparalleled degree of plasticity to the entire hippocampal circuitry3,4. Nonetheless, direct evidence of AHN in humans has remained elusive. Thus, determining whether new neurons are continuously incorporated into the human dentate gyrus (DG) during physiological and pathological aging is a crucial question with outstanding therapeutic potential. By combining human brain samples obtained under tightly controlled conditions and state-of-the-art tissue processing methods, we identified thousands of immature neurons in the DG of neurologically healthy human subjects up to the ninth decade of life. These neurons exhibited variable degrees of maturation along differentiation stages of AHN. In sharp contrast, the number and maturation of these neurons progressively declined as AD advanced. These results demonstrate the persistence of AHN during both physiological and pathological aging in humans and provide evidence for impaired neurogenesis as a potentially relevant mechanism underlying memory deficits in AD that might be amenable to novel therapeutic strategies.},

Some previous studies have reported structural brain changes as well as cognitive deficits in non-demented APOE $\varepsilon$4 carriers, but the pattern of results is inconsistent and studies with larger sample sizes have been called for. Here we compared hippocampal volume and recognition–memory performance between AD-symptom-free carriers (N=30) and non-carriers (N=30) of the APOE $\varepsilon$4 (age range: 49–79 years). We observed reduced right hippocampal volume in APOE $\varepsilon$4 carriers, and found that the difference was most pronounced before the age of 65. Further, the APOE $\varepsilon$4 carriers made significantly more false alarms in the recognition–memory test, and the number of false alarms correlated significantly with right hippocampus volume. These results indicate that relatively young individuals at genetic risk for AD have smaller hippocampal volume and lower performance on hippocampal-dependent cognitive tasks. A question for the future is whether smaller hippocampal volume represents early-onset hippocampal volume reduction or an inherent trait.},

To determine if Apo e4 has subfield specific effects in controls. 2. To study the influence of Apo e4 on hippocampal subfields in AD. METHODS 81 subjects (66 controls, mean age 60.8+/-13.6, range: 28-85 years), and 15 AD (mean age 67.5+/-9.3) were studied. Entorhinal cortex, subiculum, CA1, CA1-CA2 transition zone, CA3-4 and dentate gyrus (CA3{\&}DG) and total hippocampal volume were determined using a manual marking strategy. RESULTS Significant effects for Apo e4 on the CA3{\&}DG were found in the total control population (p=0.042) and in older controls (61-85 years) (p=0.036) but not in younger (28-60 years) controls.

abstract = {Prior studies reported that the hippocampal volume is smaller in Alzheimer's disease patients carrying the Apolipoprotein E $\epsilon$4 allele (APOE4) versus patients who are non-carriers of this allele. This effect however has not been detected consistently, possibly because of the regionally-specific involvement of the hippocampal formation in Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the local effect of APOE4 on hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease patients. Using high-resolution T1-weighted images we investigated 14 patients heterozygous for the $\epsilon$4 allele (age 72 ± 8. SD years; MMSE 20 ± 4. SD) and 14 patients not carrying the $\epsilon$4 allele (age 71 ± 10; MMSE 20 ± 5. SD), and 28 age-, sex-, and education-matched controls (age 71 ± 8; MMSE 29 ± 1. SD). The hippocampal formation was outlined with manual tracing and 3D parametric surface models were created for each subject. Radial atrophy was assessed on the whole hippocampal surface using the UCLA mapping technique. E4 carriers and non-carriers did not differ in their level of impairment in global cognition (p =0.91, Mann-Whitney test) or memory (p {\textgreater}0.29). Hippocampal surface analysis showed the typical pattern of CA1 and subicular tissue atrophy in both $\epsilon$4-carriers and non-carriers compared with controls (e4 carriers: p {\textless}0.0002; $\epsilon$4 non-carriers: p {\textless}0.01, permutation test). The left hippocampal volume was significantly smaller in $\epsilon$4-carriers than non-carriers (p =0.044, Mann-Whitney test), the effect of APOE4 mapping to the subicular/CA1 region (p =0.041, permutation test). Differences were not statistically significant in the right hippocampus (p {\textgreater}0.20, permutation test). These findings show that hippocampal atrophy is greater in APOE4 carriers in regions typically affected by pathology. APOE4 may affect the structural expression of Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The E4 allele of the ApoE gene has consistently been shown to be related to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The E4 allele is also associated with functional and structural grey matter (GM) changes in healthy young, middle-aged and older subjects. Here, we assess volumes of deep grey matter structures of 22 healthy younger ApoE4 carriers and 22 non-carriers (20-38 years). Volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus and brain stem were calculated by FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) algorithm. A significant drop in volume was found in the right hippocampus of ApoE4 carriers (ApoE4+) relative to non-carriers (ApoE4-), while there was a borderline significant decrease in the volume of the left hippocampus of ApoE4 carriers. The volumes of no other structures were found to be significantly affected by genotype. Atrophy has been found to be a sensitive marker of neurodegenerative changes, and our results show that within a healthy young population, the presence of the ApoE4+ carrier gene leads to volume reduction in a structure that is vitally important for memory formation. Our results suggest that the hippocampus may be particularly vulnerable to further degeneration in ApoE4 carriers as they enter middle and old age. Although volume reductions were noted bilaterally in the hippocampus, atrophy was more pronounced in the right hippocampus. This finding relates to previous work which has noted a compensatory increase in right hemisphere activity in ApoE4 carriers in response to preclinical declines in memory function. Possession of the ApoE4 allele may lead to greater predilection for right hemisphere atrophy even in healthy young subjects in their twenties.},

abstract = {The E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE4) is the major known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a dramatic increase in the risk of developing AD as the number of APOE4 alleles increases from 0 to 2. For this reason, asymptomatic APOE4 carriers as a group offer a great opportunity to search for the presence of early biomarkers for AD. The present article reviews neuroimaging studies on APOE4 carriers, focusing on cognitively normal individuals and on the main neuroimaging biomarkers for AD, i.e. atrophy with structural MRI, hypometabolism with FDG-PET, and amyloid deposition with amyloid-PET imaging. State of the art There are a great number of studies on the effect of APOE4 on brain structures, and they tend to show significant atrophy in APOE4 carriers compared to non-carriers especially in regions susceptible to AD pathology such as the hippocampus. However, results are rather discrepant which suggests that the effect of APOE4 on brain structure is subtle. As for FDG-PET metabolism, the few available studies show decreased metabolism, again especially in AD-sensitive regions such as posterior associative parietal areas, with a dose-dependent effect (i.e. worsening as the number of APOE4 alleles increases). Finally, there is a unanimous and major effect of APOE4 on amyloid deposition with an increase in A$\beta$ load as the number of APOE4 alleles increases and a decrease in the age of predicted amyloid-positivity in APOE4 carriers. This graded effect of APOE4 on atrophy, hypometabolism, and amyloid deposition is consistent with multimodal neuroimaging studies suggestive of a predominant effect of APOE4 on amyloid rather than tau-related injury and on brain metabolism rather than brain structure. Neuroimaging studies also suggest that APOE4 effects may be mediated by both A$\beta$-dependent and A$\beta$-independent pathological processes. This contradicts the view that A$\beta$ pathology is a necessary upstream event to neuronal injury in AD. Perspectives and conclusion Future studies should tell whether the mechanisms and sequences evidenced in carriers are comparable to those found in non-carriers, but it is likely that APOE4 not only influences the risk for AD, but also modulates the pathophysiological cascade. Altogether, APOE4 carriers offer a great opportunity to investigate brain changes in the asymptomatic stages of AD and to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, although precaution is needed for interpretation in AD at large. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Recently, multiple-atlas segmentation (MAS) has achieved a great success in the medical imaging area. The key assumption is that multiple atlases have greater chances of correctly labeling a target image than a single atlas. However, the problem of atlas selection still remains unexplored. Traditionally, image similarity is used to select a set of atlases. Unfortunately, this heuristic criterion is not necessarily related to the final segmentation performance. To solve this seemingly simple but critical problem, we propose a learning-based atlas selection method to pick up the best atlases that would lead to a more accurate segmentation. Our main idea is to learn the relationship between the pairwise appearance of observed instances (i.e., a pair of atlas and target images) and their final labeling performance (e.g., using the Dice ratio). In this way, we select the best atlases based on their expected labeling accuracy. Our atlas selection method is general enough to be integrated with any existing MAS method. We show the advantages of our atlas selection method in an extensive experimental evaluation in the ADNI, SATA, IXI, and LONI LPBA40 datasets. As shown in the experiments, our method can boost the performance of three widely used MAS methods, outperforming other learning-based and image-similarity-based atlas selection methods.},

abstract = {Background: The hippocampus and hippocampal subfields have been found to be diversely affected in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and early stages of Alzheimer's disease by neuroimaging studies. However, our knowledge is still lacking about the trajectories of the hippocampus and hippocampal subfields atrophy with the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Objective: To identify which subfields of the hippocampus differ in the trajectories of Alzheimer's disease by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to determine whether individual differences on memory could be explained by structural volumes of hippocampal subfields. Methods: Four groups of participants including 41 AD patients, 43 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, 35 subjective cognitive decline (SCD) patients and 42 normal controls (NC) received their structural MRI brain scans. Structural MR images were processed by the FreeSurfer 6.0 image analysis suite to extract the hippocampus and its subfields. Furthermore, we investigated relationships between hippocampal subfield volumes and memory test variables (AVLT-immediate recall, AVLT-delayed recall, AVLT-recognition) and the regression model analyses were controlled for age, gender, education and eTIV. Results: CA1, subiculum, presubiculum, molecular layer and fimbria showed the trend toward significant volume reduction among four groups with the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Volume of left subiculum was most strongly and actively correlated with performance across AVLT measures. Conclusion: The trend changes in the hippocampus subfields and further illustrates that SCD is the preclinical stage of AD earlier than aMCI. Future studies should aim to associate the atrophy of the hippocampal subfields in SCD with possible conversion to aMCI or AD with longitudinal design.},

Hence, several studies have compared the brain characteristics of APOE4 carriers versus non-carriers in presymptomatic stages to determine early AD biomarkers. The present review provides an overview on APOE4-related brain changes in cognitively normal individuals, focusing on the main neuroimaging biomarkers for AD, i.e. cortical beta-amyloid (A$\beta$) deposition, hypometabolism and atrophy. The most consistent findings are observed with A$\beta$ deposition as most studies report significantly higher cortical A$\beta$ load in APOE4 carriers compared with non-carriers. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography studies are rare and tend to show hypometabolism in brain regions typically impaired in AD. Structural magnetic resonance imaging findings are the most numerous and also the most discrepant, showing atrophy in AD-sensitive regions in some studies but contradicting results as well. Altogether, this suggests a graded effect of APOE4, with a predominant effect on A$\beta$ over brain structure and metabolism. Multimodal studies confirm this view and also suggest that APOE4 effects on brain structure and function are mediated by both A$\beta$-dependent and A$\beta$-independent pathological processes. Neuroimaging studies on asymptomatic APOE4 carriers offer relevant information to the understanding of early pathological mechanisms of the disease, although caution is needed as to whether APOE4 effects reflect AD pathological processes, and are representative of these effects in non-carriers.},

abstract = {Histopathological studies and animal models suggest that different physiological and pathophysiological processes exert different subfield specific effects on the hippocampus. High-resolution images at 4T depict details of the internal structure of the hippocampus allowing for in vivo volumetry of hippocampal subfields. The aims of this study were (1) to determine patterns of hippocampal subfield volume loss due to normal aging and Apo e4 carrier state, (2) to determine subfield specific volume losses due to preclinical (MCI) and clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their modification due to age and Apo e4 carrier state. One hundred fifty seven subjects (119 cognitively healthy elderly controls, 20 MCI and 18 AD) were studied with a high resolution T2 weighted imaging sequence obtained at 4T aimed at the hippocampus. Apo e4 carrier state was known in 95 subjects (66 controls, 14 MCI, 15 AD). Subiculum (SUB), CA1, CA1-CA2 transition zone (CA1-2 transition), CA3- dentate gyrus (CA3{\&}DG) were manually marked. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test for effects of age, Apo e4 carrier state and effects of MCI and AD on different hippocampal subfields. Age had a significant negative effect on CA1 and CA3{\&}DG volumes in controls (P {\textless}0.05). AD had significantly smaller volumes of SUB, CA1, CA1-2 transition, and MCI had smaller CA1-2 transition volumes than controls (P {\textless}0.05). Apo e4 carrier state was associated with volume loss in CA3{\&}DG compared to non-Apo e4 carriers in healthy controls and AD. Based on these findings, we conclude that subfield volumetry provides regional selective information that allows to distinguish between different normal and pathological processes affecting the hippocampus and thus for an improved differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases affecting the hippocampus.},

abstract = {Structural deformity of the hippocampus is characteristic of individuals with very mild and mild forms of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The purpose of this study was to determine whether a similar deformity of the hippocampus can predict the onset of dementia in nondemented elders. Using high dimensional diffeomorphic transformations of a neuroanatomical template, hippocampal volumes and surfaces were defined in 49 nondemented elders; the hippocampal surface was subsequently partitioned into three zones (i.e., lateral, superior and inferior-medial), which were proximal to the underlying CA1 subfield, CA2-4 subfields plus dentate gyrus, and subiculum, respectively. Annual clinical assessments using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), where CDR 0 indicates no dementia and CDR 0.5 indicates very mild dementia, were then performed for a mean of 4.9 years (range 0.9-7.1 years) to monitor subjects who converted from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5. Inward variation of the lateral zone and left hippocampal volume significantly predicted conversion to CDR 0.5 in separate Cox proportional hazards models. When hippocampal surface variation and volume were included in a single model, inward variation of the lateral zone of the left hippocampal surface was selected as the only significant predictor of conversion. The pattern of hippocampal surface deformation observed in nondemented subjects who later converted to CDR 0.5 was similar to the pattern of hippocampal surface deformation previously observed to discriminate subjects with very mild DAT and nondemented subjects. These results suggest that inward deformation of the left hippocampal surface in a zone corresponding to the CA1 subfield is an early predictor of the onset of DAT in nondemented elderly subjects. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have abnormally low positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgI) in regions of the precuneus and the posterior cingulate, parietotemporal, and frontal cortex. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$4 gene dose (i.e., the number of $\epsilon$4 alleles in a person's APOE genotype) is associated with a higher risk of AD and a younger age at dementia onset. We previously found that cognitively normal late-middle-aged APOE $\epsilon$4 carriers have abnormally low CMRgl in the same brain regions as patients with probable Alzheimer's dementia. In a PET study of 160 cognitively normal subjects 47-68 years of age, including 36 $\epsilon$4 homozygotes, 46 heterozygotes, and 78 $\epsilon$4 noncarriers who were individually matched for their gender, age, and educational level, we now find that $\epsilon$4 gene dose is correlated with lower CMRgl in each of these brain regions. This study raises the possibility of using PET as a quantitative presymptomatic endophenotype to help evaluate the individual and aggregate effects of putative genetic and nongenetic modifiers of AD risk. {\textcopyright}2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E, type epsilon 4 allele (APOE epsilon 4), is associated with late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is high avidity and specific binding of amyloid beta-peptide with the protein ApoE. To test the hypothesis that late-onset familial AD may represent the clustering of sporadic AD in families large enough to be studied, we extended the analyses of APOE alleles to several series of sporadic AD patients. APOE epsilon 4 is significantly associated with a series of probable sporadic AD patients (0.36 +/- 0.042, AD, versus 0.16 +/- 0.027, controls [allele frequency estimate +/- standard error], p = 0.00031). Spouse controls did not differ from CEPH grandparent controls from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) or from literature controls. A large combined series of autopsy-documented sporadic AD patients also demonstrated highly significant association with the APOE epsilon 4 allele (0.40 +/- 0.026, p {\textless}or = 0.00001). These data support the involvement of ApoE epsilon 4 in the pathogenesis of late-onset familial and sporadic AD. ApoE isoforms may play an important role in the metabolism of beta-peptide, and APOE epsilon 4 may operate as a susceptibility gene (risk factor) for the clinical expression of AD.},

abstract = {In a sample of 1186 healthy subjects aged 65 to 89 years who were scanned twice with MRI 3.6 years apart, we studied the effects of age and ApoE-$\epsilon$4 allele load on the rate of atrophy of grey matter and hippocampus. Rates of grey matter and hippocampal volumes loss were computed from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images using voxel-based morphometry and region of interest analysis. Longitudinal analysis showed that an age-related annual rate of grey matter volume loss was only seen in $\epsilon$4 homozygotes only (n= 14) whereas no age effect was seen $\epsilon$4 heterozygotes (n= 239) and in noncarriers (n= 933). ApoE-$\epsilon$4 homozygotes also had a significantly larger rate of hippocampal volume loss than heterozygotes or noncarriers. During the same period, no effect or interaction of ApoE genotype and age was observed on cognitive decline, as assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). These data do not suggest an $\epsilon$4 gene dose effect on the rate of hippocampal volume loss in healthy elderly subjects as most of the effect was limited to homozygotes. Hippocampal volume loss may not be a good imaging marker to understand the effect of the ApoE-$\epsilon$4 allele on the risk of dementia in a population-based setting. It could be hypothesized that the impact of a single ApoE-$\epsilon$4 allele on brain structures is largely delayed in time. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Inc.},

High-resolution T1-weighted MR images were processed using both voxel-based morphometry and region of interest analysis for hippocampal volume estimation. Significant decrease of grey matter in $\epsilon$4homozygous subjects (n = 12), as compared both to $\epsilon$4heterozygous subjects (n = 175) and to noncarrier (n = 563) subjects, was found bilaterally in the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, and extending over the superior temporal gyrus. By contrast, no significant difference was observed between $\epsilon$4heterozygous subjects and noncarriers at the level of the medial temporal lobe. Follow-up of the cohort cognitive performances over 4 years after their MRI exam revealed that, as compared to noncarrier subjects, the relative risk of cognitive impairment was 5.9 for $\epsilon$4homozygous subjects (P = 0.03), while it was not different from 1 for $\epsilon$4heterozygous subjects (P = 0.92).

abstract = {In genetic association study of quantitative traits using F∞ models, how to code the marker genotypes and interpret the model parameters appropriately is important for constructing hypothesis tests and making statistical inferences. Currently, the coding of marker genotypes in building F∞ models has mainly focused on the biallelic case. A thorough work on the coding of marker genotypes and interpretation of model parameters for F∞ models is needed especially for genetic markers with multiple alleles. In this study, we will formulate F∞ genetic models under various regression model frameworks and introduce three genotype coding schemes for genetic markers with multiple alleles. Starting from an allele-based modeling strategy, we first describe a regression framework to model the expected genotypic values at given markers. Then, as extension from the biallelic case, we introduce three coding schemes for constructing fully parameterized one-locus F∞ models and discuss the relationships between the model parameters and the expected genotypic values. Next, under a simplified modeling framework for the expected genotypic values, we consider several reduced one-locus F∞ models from the three coding schemes on the estimability and interpretation of their model parameters. Finally, we explore some extensions of the one-locus F∞ models to two loci. Several fully parameterized as well as reduced two-locus F∞ models are addressed. The genotype coding schemes provide different ways to construct F∞ models for association testing of multi-allele genetic markers with quantitative traits. Which coding scheme should be applied depends on how convenient it can provide the statistical inferences on the parameters of our research interests. Based on these F∞ models, the standard regression model fitting tools can be used to estimate and test for various genetic effects through statistical contrasts with the adjustment for environmental factors.},

abstract = {APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 is the best-established genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, while homozygotes show greater disease susceptibility and earlier age of onset than heterozygotes, they may not show faster rates of clinical progression. We hypothesize that there are differential APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 allele-load dependent influences on neuropathology across the brain. Our aim was to define the relationship between APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 allele load and regionally-specific brain cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). For this reason voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed using T1-weighted MR images from 83 AD patients, contrasting regional cortical grey matter by APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 load according to either dominant or genotypic models. Patients fulfilled NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and were genotyped for APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 (15 e{\{}open{\}}4/e{\{}open{\}}4, 39 e{\{}open{\}}4/- and 29-/-). We observed that grey matter volume (GMV) decreased additively with increasing allele load in the medial (MTL) and anterior temporal lobes bilaterally. By contrast, a 2 degree-of-freedom genotypic model suggested a dominant effect of the APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 allele in the left temporal lobe. Brain regions showing a significant APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 allele load effect on GMV in AD included only some of those typically described as having greatest amyloid plaque deposition and atrophy. Temporal regions appeared to show a dominant effect of APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 allele load instead of the additive effect previously strongly associated with age of onset. Regional variations with allele load may be related to different mechanisms for effects of APOE e{\{}open{\}}4 load on susceptibility and disease progression. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Studying morphological changes of subcortical structures often predicate neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Hence, methods for quantifying morphological variations in the brain anatomy, including groupwise shape analyses, are becoming increasingly important for studying neurological disorders. In this paper, a novel groupwise shape analysis approach is proposed to detect regional morphological alterations in subcortical structures between two study groups, e.g., healthy and pathological subjects. The proposed scheme extracts smoothed triangulated surface meshes from segmented binary maps, and establishes reliable point-to-point correspondences among the population of surfaces using a spectral matching method. Mean curvature features are incorporated in the matching process, in order to increase the accuracy of the established surface correspondence. The mean shapes are created as the geometric mean of all surfaces in each group, and a distance map between these shapes is used to characterize the morphological changes between the two study groups. The resulting distance map is further analyzed to check for statistically significant differences between two populations. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on two separate subcortical structures (hippocampus and putamen). Furthermore, the proposed methodology is validated in a clinical application for detecting abnormal subcortical shape variations in Alzheimer's disease. Experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms, has less computational cost, and is more sensitive to small morphological variations in patients with neuropathologies.},

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), many research groups have modeled localized changes in hippocampal and lateral ventricular surfaces, to provide candidate biomarkers of disease progression for drug trials. We combined the power of parametric surface modeling and tensor-based morphometry to study hippocampal differences associated with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in 490 subjects (97 AD, 245 MCI, 148 controls) and ventricular differences in 804 subjects scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; 184 AD, 391 MCI, 229 controls). We aimed to show that a new multivariate surface statistic based on multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial distance provides a more powerful way to detect localized anatomical differences than conventional surface-based analysis. In our experiments, we studied correlations between hippocampal atrophy and ventricular enlargement and clinical measures and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. The new multivariate statistics gave better effect sizes for detecting morphometric differences, relative to other statistics including radial distance, analysis of the surface tensor and the Jacobian determinant. In empirical tests using false discovery rate curves, smaller sample sizes were needed to detect associations with diagnosis. The analysis pipeline is generic and automated. It may be applied to analyze other brain subcortical structures including the caudate nucleus and putamen. This publically available software may boost power for morphometric studies of subcortical structures in the brain.},

The major strengths of our framework are twofold: (a) SPM-DA provides potentially more powerful algorithms than standard RFT methods for detecting weak signals, and (b) the framework embraces the important hippocampal subfield information for improved biological interpretation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method via an application to an AD cohort, where an SPM-DA method detects meaningful hippocampal shape differences in EMCI that are undetected by standard RFT methods.},

abstract = {We propose a generic method for the statistical analysis of collections of anatomical shape complexes, namely sets of surfaces that were previously segmented and labeled in a group of subjects. The method estimates an anatomical model, the template complex, that is representative of the population under study. Its shape reflects anatomical invariants within the dataset. In addition, the method automatically places control points near the most variable parts of the template complex. Vectors attached to these points are parameters of deformations of the ambient 3D space. These deformations warp the template to each subject's complex in a way that preserves the organization of the anatomical structures. Multivariate statistical analysis is applied to these deformation parameters to test for group differences. Results of the statistical analysis are then expressed in terms of deformation patterns of the template complex, and can be visualized and interpreted. The user needs only to specify the topology of the template complex and the number of control points. The method then automatically estimates the shape of the template complex, the optimal position of control points and deformation parameters. The proposed approach is completely generic with respect to any type of application and well adapted to efficient use in clinical studies, in that it does not require point correspondence across surfaces and is robust to mesh imperfections such as holes, spikes, inconsistent orientation or irregular meshing.The approach is illustrated with a neuroimaging study of Down syndrome (DS). The results demonstrate that the complex of deep brain structures shows a statistically significant shape difference between control and DS subjects. The deformation-based modelingis able to classify subjects with very high specificity and sensitivity, thus showing important generalization capability even given a low sample size. We show that the results remain significant even if the number of control points, and hence the dimension of variables in the statistical model, are drastically reduced. The analysis may even suggest that parsimonious models have an increased statistical performance.The method has been implemented in the software Deformetrica, which is publicly available at www.deformetrica.org. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Late-onset depression often precedes the onset of dementia associated with the hippocampal degeneration. Using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM), we evaluated apolipoprotein E epsilon-4 allele (apoE E4) effects on hippocampal volume and shape in 38 depressed patients without the apoE E4, 14 depressed patients with one apoE E4, and 31 healthy comparison subjects without the apoE E4. The hippocampal volumes were manually assessed. We applied a diffeomorphic template generation procedure for creating the hippocampal templates based on a subset of the population. The LDDMM mappings were used to generate the hippocampal shape of each subject and characterize the surface deformation of each hippocampus relative to the template. Such deformation was modeled as random field characterized by the Laplace-Beltrami basis functions in the template coordinates. Linear regression was used to examine group differences in the hippocampal volume and shape. We found that there were significant hippocampal shape alternations in both depressed groups while the groups of depressed patients and the group of healthy subjects did not differ in the hippocampal volume. The depressed patients with one apoE E4 show more pronounced shape inward-compression in the anterior CA1 than the depressed patients without the apoE E4 when compared with the healthy controls without the apoE E4. Thus, hippocampal shape abnormalities in late-onset depressed patients with one apoE E4 may indicate future conversion of this group to AD at higher risk than depressed patients without the apoE E4. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Brain atrophy as measured from structural MR images, is one of the primary imaging biomarkers used to track neurodegenerative disease progression. In diseases such as frontotemporal dementia or Alzheimer's disease, atrophy can be observed in key brain structures years before any clinical symptoms are present. Atrophy is most commonly captured as volume change of key structures and the shape changes of these structures are typically not analysed despite being potentially more sensitive than summary volume statistics over the entire structure. In this paper we propose a spatiotemporal analysis pipeline based on Large Diffeomorphic Deformation Metric Mapping (LDDMM) to detect shape changes from volumetric MRI scans. We applied our framework to a cohort of individuals with genetic variants of frontotemporal dementia and healthy controls from the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI) study. Our method, take full advantage of the LDDMM framework, and relies on the creation of a population specific average spatiotemporal trajectory of a relevant brain structure of interest, the thalamus in our case. The residuals from each patient data to the average spatiotemporal trajectory are then clustered and studied to assess when presymptomatic mutation carriers differ from healthy control subjects. We found statistical differences in shape in the anterior region of the thalamus at least five years before the mutation carrier subjects develop any clinical symptoms. This region of the thalamus has been shown to be predominantly connected to the frontal lobe, consistent with the pattern of cortical atrophy seen in the disease.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is widely studied with neuroimaging techniques given its importance in learning and memory and its potential as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its complex folding anatomy often presents analytical challenges. In particular, the critical subfield information is typically not addressed by the existing hippocampal shape studies. To bridge this gap, we present a computational framework for surface-based morphometric analysis of hippocampal subfields. The major strengths of this framework are as follows: (a) it performs detailed hippocampal shape analysis, (b) it embraces, rather than ignores, the important hippocampal subfield information, and (c) it analyzes regular magnetic resonance imaging scans and is applicable to large scale studies. We demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to the identification of regional hippocampal subfield atrophy patterns associated with mild cognitive impairment and AD.},

abstract = {Accurately recovering the hippocampal shapes against rough and noisy segmentations is as challenging as achieving good anatomical correspondence between the individual shapes. To address these issues, we propose a mesh-to-volume registration approach, characterized by a progressive model deformation. Our model implements flexible weighting scheme for model rigidity under a multi-level neighborhood for vertex connectivity. This method induces a large-to-small scale deformation of a template surface to build the pairwise correspondence by minimizing geometric distortion while robustly restoring the individuals' shape characteristics. We evaluated the proposed method's 1) accuracy and robustness in smooth surface reconstruction, 2) sensitivity in detecting significant shape differences between healthy control and disease groups (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease), 3) robustness in constructing the anatomical correspondence between individual shape models, and 4) applicability in identifying subtle shape changes in relation to cognitive abilities in a healthy population. We compared the performance of the proposed method with other well-known methods - SPHARM-PDM, ShapeWorks and LDDMM volume registration with template injection - using various metrics of shape similarity, surface roughness, volume, and shape deformity. The experimental results showed that the proposed method generated smooth surfaces with less volume differences and better shape similarity to input volumes than others. The statistical analyses with clinical variables also showed that it was sensitive in detecting subtle shape changes of hippocampus.},

Having better control over the parameters allows us to generalize the model to a regression setting where the effect of predictors on shapes can be considered. The methodology is illustrated and tested using both simulated scenarios and a real data set concerning eight anatomical landmarks on a sagittal plane of the corpus callosum in patients with autism and in a group of controls.},

abstract = {In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, significant attention has been paid to the analysis of the hippocampus (HC) within the medial temporal lobe because of its importance in memory and learning, and its role in neurodegenerative diseases. Manual segmentation protocols have established a volume decline in the HC in conjunction with Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. Furthermore, recent studies have investigated age-related changes of HC volume which show an interaction with gender; in early adulthood, volume reduction of the HC is found in men but not in women. In this paper, we investigated gender differences in normal subjects in young adulthood by employing a shape analysis of the HC using medial surfaces. For each subject, the most prominent medial manifold of the HC was extracted and flattened. The flattened sheets were then registered using both a rigid and a non-rigid alignment technique, and the medial surface radius was expressed as a height function over them. This allowed for an investigation of the association between subject variables and the local width of the HC. With regard to the effects of age and gender, it could be shown that the previously observed gender differences were mostly due to volume loss in males in the lateral areas of the HC head and tail. We suggest that the analysis of HC shape using medial surfaces might thus serve as a complimentary technique to investigate group differences to the established segmentation protocols for volume quantification in MRI. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Major depression in the elderly is associated with brain structural changes and vascular lesions. Changes in the subcortical regions of the limbic system have also been noted. Studies examining hippocampus volumetric differences in depression have shown variable results, possibly due to any volume differences being secondary to local shape changes rather than differences in the overall volume. Shape analysis offers the potential to detect such changes. The present study applied spherical harmonic (SPHARM) shape analysis to the left and right hippocampi of 61 elderly subjects with major depression an 43 non-depressed elderly subjects. Statistical models controlling for age, sex, and total cerebral volume showed a significant reduction in depressed compared with control subjects in the left hippocampus (F1.103=5.26; p=0.0240) but not right hippocampus volume (F1.103=0.5213). Shape analysis showed significant differences in the mid-body of the left (but not the right hippocampus between depressed and controls. When the depressed group was dichotomozed into those whose depression was remitted at time of imaging and those who were unremitted, the shape comparison showed remitted subjects to be indistinguishable from controls (both sides) while the unremitted subjects different in the midbody and the lateral side near the head. Hippocampal volume showed no difference between controls and remitted subjects but nonremitted subjects had significantly smaller left hippocampal volumes with no significant group differences in the right hippocampus. These findings may provide support to other reports of neurogenic effects of antidepressants and their relation to successful treatment for depressive symptoms. {\textcopyright}2008 Zhao et al.},

@article{Singh2014,
abstract = {Abstract We develop a multivariate analysis of brain anatomy to identify the relevant shape deformation patterns and quantify the shape changes that explain corresponding variations in clinical neuropsychological measures. We use kernel Partial Least Squares (PLS) and formulate a regression model in the tangent space of the manifold of diffeomorphisms characterized by deformation momenta. The scalar deformation momenta completely encode the diffeomorphic changes in anatomical shape. In this model, the clinical measures are the response variables, while the anatomical variability is treated as the independent variable. To better understand the “shape—clinical response” relationship, we also control for demographic confounders, such as age, gender, and years of education in our regression model. We evaluate the proposed methodology on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using baseline structural MR imaging data and neuropsychological evaluation test scores. We demonstrate the ability of our model to quantify the anatomical deformations in units of clinical response. Our results also demonstrate that the proposed method is generic and generates reliable shape deformations both in terms of the extracted patterns and the amount of shape changes. We found that while the hippocampus and amygdala emerge as mainly responsible for changes in test scores for global measures of dementia and memory function, they are not a determinant factor for executive function. Another critical finding was the appearance of thalamus and putamen as most important regions that relate to executive function. These resulting anatomical regions were consistent with very high confidence irrespective of the size of the population used in the study. This data-driven global analysis of brain anatomy was able to reach similar conclusions as other studies in Alzheimer's disease based on predefined ROIs, together with the identification of other new patterns of deformation. The proposed methodology thus holds promise for discovering new patterns of shape changes in the human brain that could add to our understanding of disease progression in neurological disorders.},

We detected significant hippocampal and amygdalar volumetric atrophies in AD relative to healthy controls (HCs). Shape analysis revealed significant region-specific atrophies with the hippocampal atrophy mainly being concentrated on the CA1 and CA2 while the amygdalar atrophy was concentrated on the basolateral and basomedial. In all structures, the structural integrity displayed a significantly decreased mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value and an increased mean trace value in AD. In addition to the inter-group comparisons, we systematically evaluated the discriminative power of our three types of features (volume, shape, and DTI), both individually and in their possible combinations, when differentiating between AD and HCs. We found the volume features to be redundant when the more sophisticated shape features were available. A combination of the shape and DTI features of the right hippocampus, with classification automatically performed by support vector machine, yielded the strongest classification result (overall accuracy, 94.6{\%}; sensitivity, 95.5{\%}; specificity, 93.3{\%}).},

abstract = {This paper uses diffeomorphometry methods to quantify the order in which statistically significant morphometric change occurs in three medial temporal lobe regions, the amygdala, entorhinal cortex (ERC), and hippocampus among subjects with symptomatic and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Magnetic resonance imaging scans were examined in subjects who were cognitively normal at baseline, some of whom subsequently developed clinical symptoms of AD. The images were mapped to a common template, using shape-based diffeomorphometry. The multidimensional shape markers indexed through the temporal lobe structures were modeled using a changepoint model with explicit parameters, specifying the number of years preceding clinical symptom onset. Our model assumes that the atrophy rate of a considered brain structure increases years before detectable symptoms. The results demonstrate that the atrophy changepoint in the ERC occurs first, indicating significant change 8-10 years prior to onset, followed by the hippocampus, 2-4 years prior to onset, followed by the amygdala, 3 years prior to onset. The ERC is significant bilaterally, in both our local and global measures, with estimates of ERC surface area loss of 2.4{\%} (left side) and 1.6{\%} (right side) annually. The same changepoint model for ERC volume gives 3.0{\%} and 2.7{\%} on the left and right sides, respectively. Understanding the order in which changes in the brain occur during preclinical AD may assist in the design of intervention trials aimed at slowing the evolution of the disease.{\textcopyright}2014 The Authors.

Both PiB- SVaD and PiB+ AD patients had deflated shape changes in the cornus ammonis (CA) 1 and subiculum compared with NC.

abstract = {We propose in this paper a new method for the mapping of hippocampal (HC) surfaces to establish correspondences between points on HC surfaces and enable localized HC shape analysis. A novel geometric feature, the intrinsic shape context, is defined to capture the global characteristics of the HC shapes. Based on this intrinsic feature, an automatic algorithm is developed to detect a set of landmark curves that are stable across population. The direct map between a source and target HC surface is then solved as the minimizer of a harmonic energy function defined on the source surface with landmark constraints. For numerical solutions, we compute the map with the approach of solving partial differential equations on implicit surfaces. The direct mapping method has the following properties: (1) it has the advantage of being automatic; (2) it is invariant to the pose of HC shapes. In our experiments, we apply the direct mapping method to study temporal changes of HC asymmetry in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using HC surfaces from 12 AD patients and 14 normal controls. Our results show that the AD group has a different trend in temporal changes of HC asymmetry than the group of normal controls. We also demonstrate the flexibility of the direct mapping method by applying it to construct spherical maps of HC surfaces. Spherical harmonics (SPHARM) analysis is then applied and it confirms our results on temporal changes of HC asymmetry in AD. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper examines MRI analysis of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in a network of structures within the medial temporal lobe using diffeomorphometry methods coupled with high-field atlasing in which the entorhinal cortex is partitioned into eight subareas. The morphometry markers for three groups of subjects (controls, preclinical AD, and symptomatic AD) are indexed to template coordinates measured with respect to these eight subareas. The location and timing of changes are examined within the subareas as it pertains to the classic Braak and Braak staging by comparing the three groups. We demonstrate that the earliest preclinical changes in the population occur in the lateral most sulcal extent in the entorhinal cortex (alluded to as transentorhinal cortex by Braak and Braak), and then proceeds medially which is consistent with the Braak and Braak staging. We use high-field 11T atlasing to demonstrate that the network changes are occurring at the junctures of the substructures in this medial temporal lobe network. Temporal progression of the disease through the network is also examined via changepoint analysis, demonstrating earliest changes in entorhinal cortex. The differential expression of rate of atrophy with progression signaling the changepoint time across the network is demonstrated to be signaling in the intermediate caudal subarea of the entorhinal cortex, which has been noted to be proximal to the hippocampus. This coupled to the findings of the nearby basolateral involvement in amygdala demonstrates the selectivity of neurodegeneration in early AD.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose an approach for template-based shape analysis of large datasets, using diffeomorphic centroids as atlas shapes. Diffeomorphic centroid methods fit in the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework and use kernel metrics on currents to quantify surface dissimilarities. The statistical analysis is based on a Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA) performed on the set of initial momentum vectors which parametrize the deformations. We tested the approach on different datasets of hippocampal shapes extracted from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared three different centroid methods and a variational template estimation. The largest dataset is composed of 1,000 surfaces, and we are able to analyse this dataset in 26 h using a diffeomorphic centroid. Our experiments demonstrate that computing diffeomorphic centroids in place of standard variational templates leads to similar shape analysis results and saves around 70{\%} of computation time. Furthermore, the approach is able to adequately capture the variability of hippocampal shapes with a reasonable number of dimensions, and to predict anatomical features of the hippocampus, only present in 17{\%} of the population, in healthy subjects.},

abstract = {This paper describes the application of large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping to cortical surfaces based on the shape and geometric properties of subregions of the superior temporal gyrus in the human brain. The anatomical surfaces of the cortex are represented as triangulated meshes. The diffeomorphic matching algorithm is implemented by defining a norm between the triangulated meshes, based on the algorithms of Vaillant and Glaun{\`{e}}s. The diffeomorphic correspondence is defined as a flow of the extrinsic three dimensional coordinates containing the cortical surface that registers the initial and target geometry by minimizing the norm. The methods are demonstrated in 40 high-resolution MRI cortical surfaces of planum temporale (PT) constructed from subsets of the superior temporal gyrus (STG). The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated via the Euclidean positional distance, distance of normal vectors, and curvature before and after the surface matching as well as the comparison with a landmark matching algorithm. The results demonstrate that both the positional and shape variability of the anatomical configurations are being represented by the diffeomorphic maps. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The most common presentation of early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD – defined as symptom onset {\textless}65 years) is with progressive episodic memory impairment – amnestic or typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD). However, EOAD is notable for its phenotypic heterogeneity, with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) – characterised by prominent higher-order visual processing deficits and relative sparing of episodic memory – the second most common canonical phenotype. The hippocampus, which comprises a number of interconnected anatomically and functionally distinct subfields, is centrally involved in Alzheimer's disease and is a crucial mediator of episodic memory. The extent to which volumes of individual hippocampal subfields differ between different phenotypes in EOAD is unclear. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the hypothesis that patients with a PCA phenotype will exhibit differences in specific hippocampal subfield volumes compared to tAD. We studied 63 participants with volumetric T1-weighted MRI performed on the same 3T scanner: 39 EOAD patients [27 with tAD and 12 with PCA] and 24 age-matched controls. Volumetric estimates of the following hippocampal subfields for each participant were obtained using Freesurfer version 6.0: CA1, CA2/3, CA4, presubiculum, subiculum, hippocampal tail, parasubiculum, the molecular and granule cell layers of the dentate gryus (GCMLDG), the molecular layer, and the hippocampal amygdala transition area (HATA). Linear regression analyses comparing mean hippocampal subfield volumes between groups, adjusting for age, sex and head size, were performed. Using a Bonferonni-corrected p-value of p {\textless}0.0025, compared to controls, tAD was associated with atrophy in all hippocampal regions, except the parasubiculum. In PCA patients compared to controls, the strongest evidence for volume loss was in the left presubiclum, right subiculum, right GCMLDG, right molecular layer and the right HATA. Compared to PCA, patients with tAD had strong evidence for smaller volumes in left CA1 and left hippocampal tail. In conclusion, these data provide evidence that hippocampal subfield volumes differ in different phenotypes of EOAD.},

In addition to algorithmic development, many researchers have distributed end-user orientated toolboxes, which further enable the utilization of the algorithms in an "off the shelf" fashion. However, there is little work on the evaluation and validation of these techniques, which poses a rather serious challenge when interpreting their results. To address this lack of validation, we design a validation framework and then use it to test some of the most widely used toolboxes. Our initial results show inconsistencies and disagreement among four different methods. We believe this type of analysis to be critical not only for the community of algorithm designers but also perhaps more importantly to researchers who use these tools without knowing the algorithm details and seek objective criteria for tool selection.},

abstract = {Statistical shape modeling (SSM) has proven useful in many areas of biology and medicine as a new generation of morphometric approaches for the quantitative analysis of anatomical shapes. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in vivo images of anatomy has led to the development and distribution of open-source computational tools to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail and statistical power. Nonetheless, there is little work on the evaluation and validation of such tools as related to clinical applications that rely on morphometric quantifications for treatment planning. To address this lack of validation, we systematically assess the outcome of widely used off-the-shelf SSM tools, namely ShapeWorks, SPHARM-PDM, and Deformetrica, in the context of designing closure devices for left atrium appendage (LAA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients to prevent stroke, where an incomplete LAA closure may be worse than no closure. This study is motivated by the potential role of SSM in the geometric design of closure devices, which could be informed by population-level statistics, and patient-specific device selection, which is driven by anatomical measurements that could be automated by relating patient-level anatomy to population-level morphometrics. Hence, understanding the consequences of different SSM tools for the final analysis is critical for the careful choice of the tool to be deployed in real clinical scenarios. Results demonstrate that estimated measurements from ShapeWorks model are more consistent compared to models from Deformetrica and SPHARM-PDM. Furthermore, ShapeWorks and Deformetrica shape models capture clinically relevant population-level variability compared to SPHARM-PDM models.},

abstract = {Studying morphological changes of subcortical structures often predicate neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Hence, methods for quantifying morphological variations in the brain anatomy, including groupwise shape analyses, are becoming increasingly important for studying neurological disorders. In this paper, a novel groupwise shape analysis approach is proposed to detect regional morphological alterations in subcortical structures between two study groups, e.g., healthy and pathological subjects. The proposed scheme extracts smoothed triangulated surface meshes from segmented binary maps, and establishes reliable point-to-point correspondences among the population of surfaces using a spectral matching method. Mean curvature features are incorporated in the matching process, in order to increase the accuracy of the established surface correspondence. The mean shapes are created as the geometric mean of all surfaces in each group, and a distance map between these shapes is used to characterize the morphological changes between the two study groups. The resulting distance map is further analyzed to check for statistically significant differences between two populations. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on two separate subcortical structures (hippocampus and putamen). Furthermore, the proposed methodology is validated in a clinical application for detecting abnormal subcortical shape variations in Alzheimer's disease. Experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms, has less computational cost, and is more sensitive to small morphological variations in patients with neuropathologies.},

abstract = {Shape analysis has become of increasing interest to the neuroimaging community due to its potential to precisely locate morphological changes between healthy and pathological structures. This manuscript presents a comprehensive set of tools for the computation of 3D structural statistical shape analysis. It has been applied in several studies on brain morphometry, but can potentially be employed in other 3D shape problems. Its main limitations is the necessity of spherical topology.The input of the proposed shape analysis is a set of binary segmentation of a single brain structure, such as the hippocampus or caudate. These segmentations are converted into a corresponding spherical harmonic description (SPHARM), which is then sampled into a triangulated surfaces (SPHARM-PDM). After alignment, differences between groups of surfaces are computed using the Hotelling T(2) two sample metric. Statistical p-values, both raw and corrected for multiple comparisons, result in significance maps. Additional visualization of the group tests are provided via mean difference magnitude and vector maps, as well as maps of the group covariance information.The correction for multiple comparisons is performed via two separate methods that each have a distinct view of the problem. The first one aims to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) or false-positives via the extrema histogram of non-parametric permutations. The second method controls the false discovery rate and results in a less conservative estimate of the false-negatives.},

abstract = {Shape morphometry of subcortical surfaces plays an important role in analyzing normal developmental changes as well as in quantifying disease-related effects in the human brain. We present a geometric approach for joint registration, deformation, and statistical analysis of shapes of subcortical surfaces. Here, subcortical surfaces are mathematically represented by vector-fields, termed square-root normal vector fields (SRNFs), on the spherical domain. The SRNF representation allows modeling of the action of the re-parameterization group to by isometries under the standard Hilbert norm, and thus enables an elastic shape analysis. This elastic analysis results in optimal deformations between shapes and helps to quantify shape differences using geodesic lengths. Importantly, the joint registration of observed shapes in a shape class removes nuisance variability due to mis-registration in the shape data and results in parsimonious statistical shape models with improved inferences for characterizing population-based subcortical structural variability. We demonstrate the ideas for shape matching and statistical analysis of hippocampal shapes for (N=120) subjects from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Specifically, we present results for assessing group differences both by using global descriptors such as principal components and local descriptors such as deformations induced by the tangent vectors from the mean shapes to the individuals.},

The goal is twofold: (1) develop a new framework of salient feature extraction and accurate classification for 3D shape data: (2) detect hippocampal abnormalities in schizophrenia using this technique. A fine-scale spherical harmonic expansion is employed to describe a closed 3D surface object. The expansion can then easily be transformed to extract only shape information (i.e., excluding translation, rotation, and scaling) and create a shape descriptor comparable across different individuals. This representation captures shape features and is flexible enough to do shape modeling, identify statistical group differences, and generate similar synthetic shapes. Principal component analysis is used to extract a small number of independent features from high dimensional shape descriptors, and Fisher's linear discriminant is applied for pattern classification. This framework is shown to be able to perform well in distinguishing clear group differences as well as small and noisy group differences using simulated shape data. In addition, the application of this technique to real data indicates that group shape differences exist in hippocampi between healthy controls and schizophrenic patients.},

However, the dose-dependent impact of this allele on brain morphology of healthy individuals remains unclear. Methods: We analyzed gray matter volumes (GMvs) in a sample of 533 healthy middle-aged individuals with a substantial representation of e4-carriers (207 heterozygotes and 65 homozygotes). Results: We found APOE-e4 additive GMv reductions in the right hippocampus, caudate, precentral gyrus, and cerebellar crus. In these regions, the APOE genotype interacted with age, with homozygotes displaying lower GMv after the fifth decade of life. APOE-e4 was also associated to greater GMv in the right thalamus, left occipital gyrus, and right frontal cortex. Discussion: Our data indicate that APOE-e4 exerts additive effects on GMv in regions relevant for Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology already in healthy individuals. These findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased Alzheimer's disease risk in e4-carriers, suggesting a dose-dependent disease vulnerability on the brain structure level.},

abstract = {Statistical shape analysis has become of increasing interest to the neuroimaging community due to its potential to precisely locate morphological changes and thus potentially discriminate between healthy and pathological structures. This paper describes a combined boundary and medial shape analysis based on two different shape descriptions applied to a study of the hippocampus shape abnormalities in schizophrenia. The first shape description is the sampled boundary implied by the spherical harmonic SPHARM description. The second one is the medial shape description called M-rep. Both descriptions are sampled descriptions with inherent point correspondence. Their shape analysis is based on computing differences from an average template structure analyzed using standard group mean difference tests. The results of the global and local shape analysis in the presented hippocampus study exhibit the same patterns for the boundary and the medial analysis. The results strongly suggest that the normalized hippocampal shape of the schizophrenic group is different from the control group, most significantly as a deformation difference in the tail region. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {There has been increasing interest in hippocampal subfield morphometry in aging and disease using in vivo MRI. However, research on in vivo morphometry is hampered by the lack of a definitive reference model describing regional effects of aging and disease pathology on the hippocampus. To address this limitation, we built a 3D probabilistic atlas of the hippocampus combining postmortem MRI with histology, allowing us to investigate Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related effects on hippocampal subfield morphometry, derived from histology. Our results support the hypothesis of differential involvement of hippocampal subfields in AD, providing further impetus for more granular study of the hippocampus in aging and disease during life. Furthermore, this atlas provides an important anatomical reference for hippocampal subfield research. Although the hippocampus is one of the most studied structures in the human brain, limited quantitative data exist on its 3D organization, anatomical variability, and effects of disease on its subregions. Histological studies provide restricted reference information due to their 2D nature. In this paper, high-resolution (∼200 × 200 × 200 $\mu$m3) ex vivo MRI scans of 31 human hippocampal specimens are combined using a groupwise diffeomorphic registration approach into a 3D probabilistic atlas that captures average anatomy and anatomic variability of hippocampal subfields. Serial histological imaging in 9 of the 31 specimens was used to label hippocampal subfields in the atlas based on cytoarchitecture. Specimens were obtained from autopsies in patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD; 9 subjects, 13 hemispheres), of other dementia (nine subjects, nine hemispheres), and in subjects without dementia (seven subjects, nine hemispheres), and morphometric analysis was performed in atlas space to measure effects of age and AD on hippocampal subfields. Disproportional involvement of the cornu ammonis (CA) 1 subfield and stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare was found in AD, with lesser involvement of the dentate gyrus and CA2/3 subfields. An association with age was found for the dentate gyrus and, to a lesser extent, for CA1. Three-dimensional patterns of variability and disease and aging effects discovered via the ex vivo hippocampus atlas provide information highly relevant to the active field of in vivo hippocampal subfield imaging.},

Hippocampal volumes are generally smaller in AD patients carrying the e4 allele compared to e4 non-carriers. Here we examined the effect of APOE e4 on hippocampal morphometry in a large imaging database – the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We automatically segmented and constructed hippocampal surfaces from the baseline MR images of 725 subjects with known APOE genotype information including 167 with AD, 354 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 204 normal controls. High-order correspondences between hippocampal surfaces were enforced across subjects with a novel inverse consistent surface fluid registration method. Multivariate statistics consisting of multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial distance were computed for surface deformation analysis. Using Hotelling's T2 test, we found significant morphological deformation in APOE e4 carriers relative to non-carriers in the entire cohort as well as in the non-demented (pooled MCI and control) subjects, affecting the left hippocampus more than the right, and this effect was more pronounced in e4 homozygotes than heterozygotes. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that showed e4 carriers exhibit accelerated hippocampal atrophy; we extend these findings to a novel measure of hippocampal morphometry. Hippocampal morphometry has significant potential as an imaging biomarker of early stage AD.},

abstract = {Histological studies have suggested differing involvement of the hippocampal subfields in ageing and in Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to assess in vivo local hippocampal changes in ageing and Alzheimer's disease based on high resolution MRI at 3 Tesla. T(1)-weighted images were acquired from 19 Alzheimer's disease patients [age 76 +/- 6 years, three males, Mini-Mental State Examination 13 +/- 4] and 19 controls (age 74 +/- 5 years, 11 males, Mini-Mental State Examination 29 +/- 1). The hippocampal formation was isolated by manual tracing. Radial atrophy mapping was used to assess group differences and correlations by averaging hippocampal shapes across subjects using 3D parametric surface mesh models. Percentage difference, Pearson's r, and significance maps were produced. Hippocampal volumes were inversely correlated with age in older healthy controls (r = 0.56 and 0.6 to the right and left, respectively, P {\textless}0.05, corresponding to 14{\%} lower volume for every 10 years of older age from ages 65 to 85 years). Ageing-associated atrophy mapped to medial and lateral areas of the tail and body corresponding to the CA1 subfield and ventral areas of the head corresponding to the presubiculum. Significantly increased volume with older age mapped to a few small spots mainly located to the CA1 sector of the right hippocampus. Volumes were 35{\%} and 30{\%} smaller in Alzheimer's disease patients to the right and left (P {\textless}0.0005). Alzheimer's disease-associated atrophy mapped not only to CA1 areas of the body and tail corresponding to those also associated with age, but also to dorsal CA1 areas of the head unaffected by age. Regions corresponding to the CA2-3 fields were relatively spared in both ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease maps to areas in the body and tail that partly overlap those affected by normal ageing. Specific areas in the anterior and dorsal CA1 subfield involved in Alzheimer's disease were not in normal ageing. These patterns might relate to differential neural systems involved in Alzheimer's disease and ageing.},

We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes.

abstract = {The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by complex trajectories of cerebral atrophy that are affected by interactions with age and apolipoprotein E allele $\epsilon$4 (APOE4) status. In this article, we report the nonlinear volumetric changes in gray matter across the full biological spectrum of the disease, represented by the AD-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) index. This index reflects the subject's level of pathology and position along the AD continuum. We also evaluated the associated impact of the APOE4 genotype. The atrophy pattern associated with the AD-CSF index was highly symmetrical and corresponded with the typical AD signature. Medial temporal structures showed different atrophy dynamics along the progression of the disease. The bilateral parahippocampal cortices and a parietotemporal region extending from the middle temporal to the supramarginal gyrus presented an initial increase in volume which later reverted. Similarly, a portion of the precuneus presented a rather linear inverse association with the AD-CSF index whereas some other clusters did not show significant atrophy until index values corresponded to positive CSF tau values. APOE4 carriers showed steeper hippocampal volume reductions with AD progression. Overall, the reported atrophy patterns are in close agreement with those mentioned in previous findings. However, the detected nonlinearities suggest that there may be different pathological processes taking place at specific moments during AD progression and reveal the impact of the APOE4 allele.},

It is general and can be applied to any parametric deformation framework and to all shape models with which it is possible to define probability density functions (PDF). Here, both curve and surface meshes are modelled as Gaussian random varifolds, using a finite-dimensional approximation space on which PDFs can be defined. Using this framework, we can automatically estimate the parameters balancing data-terms and deformation regularity, which previously required user tuning. Moreover, it is also possible to estimate a well-conditioned covariance matrix of the deformation parameters. We also extend the proposed framework to data-sets with multiple group labels. Groups share the same template and their deformation parameters are modelled with different distributions. We can statistically compare the groups'distributions since they are defined on the same space. We test our algorithm on 20 Gilles de la Tourette patients and 20 control subjects, using three sub-cortical regions and their incident white matter fiber bundles. We compare their morphological characteristics and variations using a single diffeomorphism in the ambient space.

We quantitatively analyzed pertinent network attributes of the entire network and each node. Further to this, hierarchical analyses were performed; group comparisons were conducted at the structure level first and then the sub-region level. The bilateral amygdalae, hippocampi, as well as the thalamus were all divided into multiple functionally distinct sub-regions. From the structure level analysis, we found significant HC-vs-AD group differences in the average local efficiency and average global efficiency. In addition, the local nodal efficiencies between the right thalamus and all three of the right hippocampus, right amygdala, and left thalamus, as well as that between the left amygdala and left hippocampus, decreased significantly in AD. According to the sub-regional network analyses, we observed significant AD-induced local efficiency decreases between different sub-regions within the right hippocampus itself and between the subiculum of the right hippocampus and the sub-region of the right thalamus connecting to the temporal lobe, indicating a degradation of circuit between the hippocampus, thalamus, and temporal lobe.

[1] for the multi-region analysis of longitudinal fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images which reported classification improvements by using regional signal intensities combined with regional change over a 12 month period. In this paper we extend the approach proposed in [1] to the analysis of the entire brain pattern. Compared to [1], our method uses voxel-wise differences and avoids segmentation of the images into regions of interest. For our study, FDG-PET scans at the baseline and at 12-month follow-up of cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects were retrieved from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database. For both AD and MCI identification, the best classification results were achieved by combining cross-sectional and longitudinal information rather than using only the cross-sectional data. Furthermore, the longitudinal voxel-based analysis outperformed multi-region analysis.},

DESIGN Multicenter case-control study of neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and cognitive test score data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. SETTING Research centers across the United States and Canada. PATIENTS We examined a total of 317 participants with baseline cerebrospinal fluid biomarker measurements and 3 T1-weighted magnetic resonance images obtained within 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We used automated tools to compute annual longitudinal atrophy in the hippocampus and cortical regions targeted in AD. We used Mini-Mental State Examination scores as a measure of cognitive performance. We performed a cross-subject analysis of atrophy rates and acceleration on individuals with an AD-like cerebrospinal fluid molecular profile. RESULTS In presymptomatic individuals harboring indicators of AD, baseline thickness in AD-vulnerable cortical regions was significantly reduced compared with that of healthy control individuals, but baseline hippocampal volume was not. Across the clinical spectrum, rates of AD-specific cortical thinning increased with decreasing cognitive performance before peaking at approximately the Mini-Mental State Examination score of 21, beyond which rates of thinning started to decline. Annual rates of hippocampal volume loss showed a continuously increasing pattern with decreasing cognitive performance as low as the Mini-Mental State Examination score of 15. Analysis of the second derivative of imaging measurements revealed that AD-specific cortical thinning exhibited early acceleration followed by deceleration. Conversely, hippocampal volume loss exhibited positive acceleration across all study participants. CONCLUSIONS Alzheimer disease-specific cortical thinning and hippocampal volume loss are consistent with a sigmoidal pattern, with an acceleration phase during the early stages of the disease. Clinical trials should carefully consider the nonlinear behavior of these AD biomarkers.},

However, when used to analyze or predict the progression of a neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease, these models usually do not take into account the fact that subjects may be at different stages of disease progression and the interpretation of the model may depend on some implicit reference time. In this paper, we propose a generative statistical model for longitudinal data, described in a univariate Riemannian manifold setting, which estimates an average disease progression model, subject-specific time shifts and acceleration factors. The time shifts account for variability in age at disease-onset time. The acceleration factors account for variability in speed of disease progression. For a given individual, the estimated time shift and acceleration factor define an affine reparametrization of the average disease progression model. This statistical model has been used to analyze neuropsychological assessments scores and cortical thickness measurements from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The numerical results showed that we can distinguish between slow versus fast progressing and early versus late-onset individuals.},

abstract = {Being able to estimate a patient's progress in the course of Alzheimer's disease and predicting future progression based on a number of observed biomarker values is of great interest for patients, clinicians and researchers alike. In this work, an approach for disease progress estimation is presented. Based on a set of subjects that convert to a more severe disease stage during the study, models that describe typical trajectories of biomarker values in the course of disease are learned using quantile regression. A novel probabilistic method is then derived to estimate the current disease progress as well as the rate of progression of an individual by fitting acquired biomarkers to the models. A particular strength of the method is its ability to naturally handle missing data. This means, it is applicable even if individual biomarker measurements are missing for a subject without requiring a retraining of the model. The functionality of the presented method is demonstrated using synthetic and-employing cognitive scores and image-based biomarkers-real data from the ADNI study. Further, three possible applications for progress estimation are demonstrated to underline the versatility of the approach: classification, construction of a spatio-temporal disease progression atlas and prediction of future disease progression.},

abstract = {This longitudinal study investigates the modifications in structure and function occurring to typical Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains over a 2-year follow-up, from pre-dementia stages of disease, with the aim of identifying biomarkers of prognostic value. Thirty-one patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment were recruited and followed-up with clinical, neuropsychological, and MRI assessments. Patients were retrospectively classified as AD Converters or Non-Converters, and the data compared between groups. Cross-sectional MRI data at baseline, assessing volume and functional connectivity abnormalities, confirmed previous findings, showing a more severe pattern of regional grey matter atrophy and default-mode network disconnection in Converters than in Non-Converters. Longitudinally, Converters showed more grey matter atrophy in the frontotemporal areas, accompanied by increased connectivity in the precuneus. Discriminant analysis revealed that functional connectivity of the precuneus within the default mode network at baseline is the parameter able to correctly classify patients in Converters and Non-Converters with high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.},

Our method, known as pathways sparse reduced-rank regression (PsRRR), uses group lasso penalised regression to jointly model the effects of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), grouped into functional pathways using prior knowledge of gene-gene interactions. Pathways are ranked in order of importance using a resampling strategy that exploits finite sample variability. Our application study uses whole genome scans and MR images from 99 probable AD patients and 164 healthy elderly controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 66,182 SNPs are mapped to 185 gene pathways from the KEGG pathway database. Voxel-wise imaging signatures characteristic of AD are obtained by analysing 3D patterns of structural change at 6, 12 and 24 months relative to baseline. High-ranking, AD endophenotype-associated pathways in our study include those describing insulin signalling, vascular smooth muscle contraction and focal adhesion. All of these have been previously implicated in AD biology. In a secondary analysis, we investigate SNPs and genes that may be driving pathway selection. High ranking genes include a number previously linked in gene expression studies to beta-amyloid plaque formation in the AD brain (PIK3R3,PIK3CG,PRKCAandPRKCB), and to AD related changes in hippocampal gene expression (ADCY2, ACTN1, ACACA, and GNAI1). Other high ranking previously validated AD endophenotype-related genes include CR1, TOMM40 and APOE.},

abstract = {We investigated progression of atrophy in vivo, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We included 64 patients with AD, 44 with MCI and 34 controls with serial MRI examinations (interval 1.8 ± 0.7 years). A nonlinear registration algorithm (fluid) was used to calculate atrophy rates in six regions: frontal, medial temporal, temporal (extramedial), parietal, occipital lobes and insular cortex. In MCI, the highest atrophy rate was observed in the medial temporal lobe, comparable with AD. AD patients showed even higher atrophy rates in the extramedial temporal lobe. Additionally, atrophy rates in frontal, parietal and occipital lobes were increased. Cox proportional hazard models showed that all regional atrophy rates predicted conversion to AD. Hazard ratios varied between 2.6 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-6.2) for occipital atrophy and 15.8 (95{\%} CI = 3.5-71.8) for medial temporal lobe atrophy. In conclusion, atrophy spreads through the brain with development of AD. MCI is marked by temporal lobe atrophy. In AD, atrophy rate in the extramedial temporal lobe was even higher. Moreover, atrophy rates also accelerated in parietal, frontal, insular and occipital lobes. Finally, in nondemented elderly, medial temporal lobe atrophy was most predictive of progression to AD, demonstrating the involvement of this region in the development of AD.},

abstract = {Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) refers to a period of time prior to diagnosis during which cognitive deficits among individuals who will go on to receive a diagnosis of AD are present. There is great interest in describing the nature of cognitive change during the preclinical period, in terms of whether persons decline in a linear fashion to diagnosis, or exhibit some stability of functioning, followed by rapid losses in performance. In the current study we apply Growth Mixture Modeling to data from The Kungsholmen Project to evaluate whether decline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores during the preclinical period of AD follows a linear or quadratic function. At the end of a 7-year follow-up period, some individuals would be diagnosed with AD (n=71), whereas others would remain free of dementia (n=457). The results indicated that a two-group quadratic model of decline provided the best statistical fit measures, as well as the greatest estimates of sensitivity (67{\%}) and specificity (86{\%}). Differences in MMSE scores were apparent at baseline, but the preclinical AD group began to experience precipitous declines three years prior to diagnosis. Finally, persons who were misclassified as preclinical AD had fewer years of education and poorer MMSE scores at baseline.},

The prediction may be facilitated by accelerated whole brain atrophy exhibited by AD subjects. Iterative principal component analysis (IPCA) was used to characterize whole brain atrophy rates using sequential MRI scans for 102 MCI subjects from the Kuopio University Hospital. We modelled the likelihood of progression to probable AD, and found that each additional percent of annualized whole brain atrophy rate was associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) of progression (OR. =. 1.30, p=. 0.01, 95{\%} CI. =. 1.05-1.60).

Current methods for dementia classification rely heavily on the quality of MRI preprocessing, especially on prior registration.

We detect and track such keypoints based on scale-space theory in an automatized image processing workflow, and test it on a standardized MRI collection made available by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our approach is very efficient for processing very large datasets collected from different sites and technical devices, and first results show that characteristic scale and movement of keypoints and their tracks differ significantly between controls and diseased subjects.},

abstract = {Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between healthy and Alzheimer's disease (AD). To enable early intervention it is important to identify the MCI subjects that will convert to AD in an early stage. In this paper, we provide a new method to distinguish between MCI patients that either convert to Alzheimer's Disease (MCIc) or remain stable (MCIs), using only longitudinal T1-weighted MRI. Currently, most longitudinal studies focus on volumetric comparison of a few anatomical structures, thereby ignoring more detailed development inside and outside those structures. In this study we propose to exploit the anatomical development within the entire brain, as found by a non-rigid registration approach. Specifically, this anatomical development is represented by the Stationary Velocity Field (SVF) from registration between the baseline and follow-up images. To make the SVFs comparable among subjects, we use the parallel transport method to align them in a common space. The normalized SVF together with derived features are then used to distinguish between MCIc and MCIs subjects. This novel feature space is reduced using a Kernel Principal Component Analysis method, and a linear support vector machine is used as a classifier. Extensive comparative experiments are performed to inspect the influence of several aspects of our method on classification performance, specifically the feature choice, the smoothing parameter in the registration and the use of dimensionality reduction. The optimal result from a 10-fold cross-validation using 36 month follow-up data shows competitive results: accuracy 92{\%}, sensitivity 95{\%}, specificity 90{\%}, and AUC 94{\%}. Based on the same dataset, the proposed approach outperforms two alternative ones that either depends on the baseline image only, or uses longitudinal information from larger brain areas. Good results were also obtained when scans at 6, 12, or 24 months were used for training the classifier. Besides the classification power, the proposed method can quantitatively compare brain regions that have a significant difference in development between the MCIc and MCIs groups.},

We proposed a diffeomorphometry-based statistical pipeline to study the regional shape change rates of the bilateral hippocampus, amygdala, and ventricle in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared with healthy controls (HC), using sequential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 713 subjects (3,123 scans in total). The subgroup shape atrophy rates of the bilateral hippocampus and amygdala, as well as the expansion rates of the bilateral ventricles, for a majority of vertices were found to follow the order of AD {\textgreater}MCI {\textgreater}HC. The bilateral hippocampus and the left amygdala were subsegmented into multiple functionally meaningful subregions with the help of high-field MRI scans. The largest group differences in localized shape atrophy rates on the hippocampus were found to occur in CA1, followed by subiculum, CA2, and finally CA3/dentate gyrus, which is consistent with the neurofibrillary tangle accumulation trajectory. Highly nonuniform group differences were detected on the amygdala; vertices on the core amygdala (basolateral and lateral nucleus) revealed much larger atrophy rates, whereas those on the noncore amygdala (mainly centromedial) displayed similar or even smaller atrophy rates in AD relative to HC. The temporal horns of the ventricles were observed to have the largest localized ventricular expansion rate differences; with the AD group showing larger localized expansion rates on the anterior horn and the body part of the ventricles as well. Significant correlations were observed between the localized shape change rates of each of these six structures and the cognitive deterioration rates as quantified by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Behavior Section increase rate and the Mini Mental State Examination decrease rate.},

abstract = {Distinguishing progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) from stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) is critical for identification of patients who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), so that early treatment can be administered. In this paper, we propose a pMCI/sMCI classification framework that harnesses information available in longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which could be incomplete, to improve diagnostic accuracy. Volumetric features were first extracted from the baseline MRI scan and subsequent scans acquired after 6, 12, and 18 months. Dynamic features were then obtained using the 18th month scan as the reference and computing the ratios of feature differences for the earlier scans. Features that are linearly or non-linearly correlated with diagnostic labels are then selected using two elastic net sparse learning algorithms. Missing feature values due to the incomplete longitudinal data are imputed using a low-rank matrix completion method. Finally, based on the completed feature matrix, we build a multi-kernel support vector machine (mkSVM) to predict the diagnostic label of samples with unknown diagnostic statuses. Our evaluation indicates that a diagnosis accuracy as high as 78.2 {\%} can be achieved when information from the longitudinal scans is used-6.6 {\%} higher than the case using only the reference time point image. In other words, information provided by the longitudinal history of the disease improves diagnosis accuracy.},

However, such data are often heterogeneous, high-dimensional, noisy, and incomplete. We thus propose a framework that includes sparse feature selection, low-rank affinity pursuit denoising (LRAD), and low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) in this study. Specifically, we first use sparse linear regressions to remove unrelated features. Then, considering the heterogeneity of the MCI data, which can be assumed as a union of multiple subspaces, we propose to use a low rank subspace method (i.e., LRAD) to denoise the data. Finally, we employ LRMC algorithm with three data fitting terms and one inequality constraint for joint conversion and time-to-conversion predictions. Our framework aims to answer a very important but yet rarely explored question in AD study, i.e., when will the MCI convert to AD? This is different from survival analysis, which provides the probabilities of conversion at different time points that are mainly used for global analysis, while our time-to-conversion prediction is for each individual subject. Evaluations using the ADNI dataset indicate that our method outperforms conventional LRMC and other state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves a maximal pMCI classification accuracy of 84{\%} and time prediction correlation of 0.665.},

abstract = {Previously it was reported that Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have reduced beta amyloid (A$\beta$1-42) and elevated total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181p) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), suggesting that these same measures could be used to detect early AD pathology in healthy elderly individuals and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that there would be an association among rates of regional brain atrophy, the CSF biomarkers A$\beta$1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181pand apolipoprotein E (ApoE) $\epsilon$4 status, and that the pattern of this association would be diagnosis-specific. Our findings primarily showed that lower CSF A$\beta$1-42and higher tau concentrations were associated with increased rates of regional brain tissue loss and the patterns varied across the clinical groups. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CSF biomarker concentrations are associated with the characteristic patterns of structural brain changes in healthy elderly and mild cognitive impairment subjects that resemble to a large extent the pathology seen in AD. Therefore, the finding of faster progression of brain atrophy in the presence of lower A$\beta$1-42levels and higher tau levels supports the hypothesis that CSF A$\beta$1-42and tau are measures of early AD pathology. Moreover, the relationship among CSF biomarkers, ApoE $\epsilon$4 status, and brain atrophy rates are regionally varying, supporting the view that the genetic predisposition of the brain to beta amyloid and tau mediated pathology is regional and disease stage specific. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Using a sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, we performed three separate studies that each compared two groups of individuals to identify genes associated with disease development and progression. For each comparison we took a two-step approach: initially, using penalized linear discriminant analysis, we identified voxels that provide an imaging signature of the disease with high classification accuracy; then we used this multivariate biomarker as a phenotype in a genome-wide association study, carried out using sRRR. The genetic markers were ranked in order of importance of association to the phenotypes using a data re-sampling approach. Our findings confirmed the key role of the APOE and TOMM40 genes but also highlighted some novel potential associations with AD.},

abstract = {Brain changes due to development and maturation, normal aging, or degenerative disease are continuous, gradual, and variable across individuals. To quantify the individual progression of brain changes, we propose a spatio-temporal methodology based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and apply it on four-dimensional structural brain magnetic resonance imaging series of older individuals. First, regional brain features are extracted in order to reduce image dimensionality. This process is guided by the objective of the study or the specific imaging patterns whose progression is of interest, for example, the evaluation of Alzheimer-like patterns of brain change in normal individuals. These regional features are used in conjunction with HMMs, which aim to measure the dynamic association between brain structure changes and progressive stages of disease over time. A bagging framework is used to obtain models with good generalization capability, since in practice the number of serial scans is limited. An application of the proposed methodology was to detect individuals with the risk of developing MCI, and therefore it was tested on modeling the progression of brain atrophy patterns in older adults. With HMM models, the state-transition paths corresponding to longitudinal brain changes were constructed from two completely independent datasets, the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The statistical analysis of HMM-state paths among the normal, progressive MCI, and MCI groups indicates that, HMM-state index 1 is likely to be a predictor of the conversion from cognitively normal to MCI, potentially many years before clinical symptoms become measurable.},

abstract = {Sparse learning has been widely investigated for analysis of brain images to assist the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment. However, most existing sparse learning-based studies only adopt cross-sectional analysis methods, where the sparse model is learned using data from a single time-point. Actually, multiple time-points of data are often available in brain imaging applications, which can be used in some longitudinal analysis methods to better uncover the disease progression patterns. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel temporallyconstrained group sparse learning method aiming for longitudinal analysis with multiple time-points of data. Specifically, we learn a sparse linear regression model by using the imaging data from multiple time-points, where a group regularization term is first employed to group the weights for the same brain region across different time-points together. Furthermore, to reflect the smooth changes between data derived from adjacent time-points, we incorporate two smoothness regularization terms into the objective function, i.e., one fused smoothness term thatrequires that the differences between two successive weight vectors from adjacent time-points should be small, and another output smoothness term thatrequires the differences between outputs of two successive models from adjacent time-points should also be small. We develop an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the proposed objective function. Experimental results on ADNI database demonstrate that, compared with conventional sparse learning-based methods, our proposed method can achieve improved regression performance and also help in discovering disease-related biomarkers.},

To estimate population and individual model parameters, we adapted a stochastic version of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, the MCMC-SAEM. The model is used to describe the propagation of cortical atrophy during the course of Alzheimer's Disease. Model parameters show the variability of this aver-age pattern of atrophy in terms of trajectories across brain regions, age at disease onset and pace of propagation.

Currently, most existing methods predict different clinical scores using different models, or separately predict multiple scores at different future time points. Such approaches prevent coordinated learning of multiple predictions that can be used to jointly predict clinical scores at multiple future time points. In this paper, we propose a joint learning method for predicting clinical scores of patients using multiple longitudinal prediction models for various future time points. Three important relationships among training samples, features, and clinical scores are explored. The relationship among different longitudinal prediction models is captured using a common feature set among the multiple prediction models at different time points. Our experimental results based on the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database shows that our method achieves considerable improvement over competing methods in predicting multiple clinical scores.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Identifying predictors of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critically important for AD prevention and targeted treatment. OBJECTIVE To compare various clinical and biomarker trajectories for tracking progression and predicting conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to probable AD. METHODS Participants were from the ADNI-1 study. We assessed the ability of 33 longitudinal biomarkers to predict time to AD conversion, accounting for demographic and genetic factors. We used joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data to examine the association between changes of measures and disease progression. We also employed time-dependent receiver operating characteristic method to assess the discriminating capability of the measures. RESULTS 23 of 33 longitudinal clinical and imaging measures are significant predictors of AD conversion beyond demographic and genetic factors. The strong phenotypic and biological predictors are in the cognitive domain (ADAS-Cog; RAVLT), functional domain (FAQ), and neuroimaging domain (middle temporal gyrus and hippocampal volume). The strongest predictor is ADAS-Cog 13 with an increase of one SD in ADAS-Cog 13 increased the risk of AD conversion by 2.92 times. CONCLUSION Prediction of AD conversion can be improved by incorporating longitudinal change information, in addition to baseline characteristics. Cognitive measures are consistently significant and generally stronger predictors than imaging measures.},

abstract = {Neuroimage measures from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, such as cortical thickness, have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies show that, AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal control (NC) can be distinguished with relatively high accuracy using the baseline cortical thickness. With the increasing availability of large longitudinal datasets, it also becomes possible to study the longitudinal changes of cortical thickness and their correlation with the development of pathology in AD. In this study, the longitudinal cortical thickness changes of 152 subjects from 4 clinical groups (AD, NC, Progressive-MCI and Stable-MCI) selected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) are measured by our recently developed 4 D (spatial+temporal) thickness measuring algorithm. It is found that the 4 clinical groups demonstrate very similar spatial distribution of grey matter (GM) loss on cortex. To fully utilize the longitudinal information and better discriminate the subjects from 4 groups, especially between Stable-MCI and Progressive-MCI, 3 different categories of features are extracted for each subject, i.e., (1) static cortical thickness measures computed from the baseline and endline, (2) cortex thinning dynamics, such as the thinning speed (mm/year) and the thinning ratio (endline/baseline), and (3) network features computed from the brain network constructed based on the correlation between the longitudinal thickness changes of different regions of interest (ROIs). By combining the complementary information provided by features from the 3 categories, 2 classifiers are trained to diagnose AD and to predict the conversion to AD in MCI subjects, respectively. In the leave-one-out cross-validation, the proposed method can distinguish AD patients from NC at an accuracy of 96.1{\%}, and can detect 81.7{\%} (AUC = 0.875) of the MCI converters 6 months ahead of their conversions to AD. Also, by analyzing the brain network built via longitudinal cortical thickness changes, a significant decrease (p {\textless}0.02) of the network clustering coefficient (associated with the development of AD pathology) is found in the Progressive-MCI group, which indicates the degenerated wiring efficiency of the brain network due to AD. More interestingly, the decreasing of network clustering coefficient of the olfactory cortex region was also found in the AD patients, which suggests olfactory dysfunction. Although the smell identification test is not performed in ADNI, this finding is consistent with other AD-related olfactory studies.},

abstract = {Many large-scale longitudinal imaging studies have been or are being widely conducted to better understand the progress of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and normal brain development. The goal of this article is to develop a multiscale adaptive generalized estimation equation (MAGEE) method for spatial and adaptive analysis of neuroimaging data from longitudinal studies. MAGEE is applicable to making statistical inference on regression coefficients in both balanced and unbalanced longitudinal designs and even in twin and familial studies, whereas standard software platforms have several major limitations in handling these complex studies. Specifically, conventional voxel-based analyses in these software platforms involve Gaussian smoothing imaging data and then independently fitting a statistical model at each voxel. However, the conventional smoothing methods suffer from the lack of spatial adaptivity to the shape and spatial extent of region of interest and the arbitrary choice of smoothing extent, while independently fitting statistical models across voxels does not account for the spatial properties of imaging observations and noise distribution. To address such drawbacks, we adapt a powerful propagation-separation (PS) procedure to sequentially incorporate the neighboring information of each voxel and develop a new novel strategy to solely update a set of parameters of interest, while fixing other nuisance parameters at their initial estimators. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that MAGEE significantly outperforms voxel-based analysis. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that the use of integrated information from multi-modalities could significantly improve diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, feature selection, which is one of the most important steps in classification, is typically performed separately for each modality, which ignores the potentially strong inter-modality relationship within each subject. Recent emergence of multi-task learning approach makes the joint feature selection from different modalities possible. However, joint feature selection may unfortunately overlook different yet complementary information conveyed by different modalities. We propose a novel multi-task feature selection method to preserve the complementary inter-modality information. Specifically, we treat feature selection from each modality as a separate task and further impose a constraint for preserving the inter-modality relationship, besides separately enforcing the sparseness of the selected features from each modality. After feature selection, a multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) is further used to integrate the selected features from each modality for classification. Our method is evaluated using the baseline PET and MRI images of subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our method achieves a good performance, with an accuracy of 94.37{\%} and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9724 for AD identification, and also an accuracy of 78.80{\%} and an AUC of 0.8284 for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identification. Moreover, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 67.83{\%} and an AUC of 0.6957 for separating between MCI converters and MCI non-converters (to AD). These performances demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art classification methods. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictors of missing data in a longitudinal study of Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a clinic-based, multicenter, longitudinal study with blood, CSF, PET, and MRI scans repeatedly measured in 229 participants with normal cognition (NC), 397 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 193 with mild AD during 2005-2007. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to examine the associations between baseline demographic/clinical features and loss of biomarker follow-ups in ADNI. RESULTS: CSF studies tended to recruit and retain patients with MCI with more AD-like features, including lower levels of baseline CSF Abeta(42). Depression was the major predictor for MCI dropouts, while family history of AD kept more patients with AD enrolled in PET and MRI studies. Poor cognitive performance was associated with loss of follow-up in most biomarker studies, even among NC participants. The presence of vascular risk factors seemed more critical than cognitive function for predicting dropouts in AD. CONCLUSION: The missing data are not missing completely at random in ADNI and likely conditional on certain features in addition to cognitive function. Missing data predictors vary across biomarkers and even MCI and AD groups do not share the same missing data pattern. Understanding the missing data structure may help in the design of future longitudinal studies and clinical trials in AD.},

By assuming separability of spatial and temporal processes we provide a very efficient and robust formulation for the marginal likelihood computation and the posterior prediction. The model adaptively accounts for local spatial correlations of the data, and the covariance structure is effectively parameterised by the Kronecker product of covariance matrices of very small size, each encoding only a single direction in space. We provide a simple and flexible framework for within- and between-subject modelling and prediction. In particular, we introduce the Hoffman-Ribak method for efficient inference on posterior processes and its uncertainty. The proposed framework is applied in the context of longitudinal modelling in Alzheimer's disease. We firstly demonstrate the advantage of our non-parametric method for modelling of within-subject structural changes. The results show that non-parametric methods demonstrably outperform conventional parametric methods. Then the framework is extended to optimize complex parametrized covariate kernels. Using Bayesian model comparison via marginal likelihood the framework enables to compare different hypotheses about individual change processes of images.},

Nonethe- less, the use of disease progression models for probabilistic predictions still requires investigation, for example for accounting for missing obser- vations in clinical data, and for accurate uncertainty quantification. We tackle this problem by proposing a novel Gaussian process-based method for the joint modeling of imaging and clinical biomarker progressions from time series of individual observations. The model is formulated to account for individual random effects and time reparameterization, al- lowing non-parametric estimates of the biomarker evolution, as well as high flexibility in specifying correlation structure, and time transforma- tion models. Thanks to the Bayesian formulation, the model naturally accounts for missing data, and allows for uncertainty quantification in the estimate of evolutions, as well as for probabilistic prediction of disease staging in unseen patients. The experimental results show that the pro- posed model provides a biologically plausible description of the evolution of Alzheimer's pathology across the whole disease time-span as well as remarkable predictive performance when tested on a large clinical cohort with missing observations.},

abstract = {Background: The morphology of the brain observed in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the contribution of different biological processes such as the normal aging and the AD-specific pathological matter loss. Being able to differentiate these complementary biological factors is fundamental in order to isolate and quantify the pathological AD-related structural changes, especially at the earliest phase of the disease, at prodromal and preclinical stages. Methods: We chose the ADNI baseline structural MRIs for 37 healthy subjects positive to the CSF Ab42 (Ab+), 86 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which subsequently converted to AD, 110 stable MCI, and 134 AD patients. For each subject, a "virtual aging" component was defined as the closest point with respect to the longitudinal deformation modeled for the healthy aging of a group of 63 normal subjects negative to the CSF Ab42 [1]. Once removed the aging component, the remaining specific morphological changes were analyzed group-wise, in order to characterize the atrophy patterns at the different clinical stages, and to test their predictive power in encoding the pathological disease progression. Results: Even though the considered groups did not significantly differ for age, the estimated virtual ages increased as the clinical condition get worse, and were significantly higher for the MCI stable, converters, and AD groups when compared to the healthy Abeta- (p{\textless}0.05, standard two sample t- test). After removing the healthy component, the morphological changes specific for the healthy Abeta+ were mild, while the changes specific for the MCI converters were more pronounced and mapped to frontal lobes, ventricles, temporal poles, entorhinal cortex and hippocampi. The same pattern, although slightly more pronounced, was appreciable for the AD patients. The stable MCIs showed a milder deformation pattern, mapping essentially to the ventricles and temporal poles. The predictive power of the specific component was 91{\%} sensitivity and 84{\%} specificity for the discrimination AD vs. healthy, and 67{\%} sensitivity and 63{\%} specificity for the discrimination MCI stable vs. MCI converters. Conclusion: We provided a rich description of the anatomical changes observed across the AD time span: normal aging, normal aging at risk, conversion to MCI and latest AD stages. More advanced AD stages were associated to both "virtually older" brains, and to increased specific morphological changes that were not related to the normal aging. Importantly, the specific changes provided a good identification of the pathological AD atrophy. These results provide new insights that can lead to new understandings of the AD dynamics, and to novel techniques for the modeling and the early detection of the disease.},

The L2R2 model integrates three key methodologies: a low-rank matrix for approximating the high-dimensional regression coefficient matrices corresponding to the genetic main effects and their interactions with time, penalized splines for characterizing the overall time effect, and a sparse factor analysis model coupled with random effects for capturing within-subject spatio-temporal correlations of longitudinal phenotypes. Posterior computation proceeds via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Simulations show that the L2R2 model outperforms several other competing methods.

abstract = {Disease progression modeling (DPM) using longitudinal data is a challenging machine learning task. Existing DPM algorithms neglect temporal dependencies among measurements, make parametric assumptions about biomarker trajectories, do not model multiple biomarkers jointly, and need an alignment of subjects' trajectories. In this paper, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to address these issues. However, in many cases, longitudinal cohorts contain incomplete data, which hinders the application of standard RNNs and requires a pre-processing step such as imputation of the missing values. Instead, we propose a generalized training rule for the most widely used RNN architecture, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that can handle both missing predictor and target values. The proposed LSTM algorithm is applied to model the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using six volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers, i.e., volumes of ventricles, hippocampus, whole brain, fusiform, middle temporal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex, and it is compared to standard LSTM networks with data imputation and a parametric, regression-based DPM method. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) than the alternatives with p {\textless}0.05 using Wilcoxon signed rank test in predicting values of almost all of the MRI biomarkers. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier applied to the predicted biomarker values produces a significantly larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90 vs. at most 0.84 with p {\textless}0.001 using McNemar's test for clinical diagnosis of AD. Inspection of MAE curves as a function of the amount of missing data reveals that the proposed LSTM algorithm achieves the best performance up until more than 74{\%} missing values. Finally, it is illustrated how the method can successfully be applied to data with varying time intervals. This paper shows that built-in handling of missing values in training an LSTM network benefits the application of RNNs in neurodegenerative disease progression modeling in longitudinal cohorts.},

Ever-evolving techniques and analytical methods provide new avenues to explore and questions to consider, requiring researchers to balance excitement with caution. This review addresses what MRI studies of structural brain development in children and adolescents typically measure and how. We focus on measurements of brain morphometry (e.g., volume, cortical thickness, surface area, folding patterns), as well as measurements derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). By integrating finding from multiple longitudinal investigations, we give an update on current knowledge of structural brain development and how it relates to other aspects of biological development and possible underlying physiological mechanisms. Further, we review and discuss current strategies in image processing, analysis techniques and modeling of brain development. We hope this review will aid current and future longitudinal investigations of brain development, as well as evoke a discussion amongst researchers regarding best practices. ??

abstract = {The goal of this study is to introduce a nonparametric technique for predicting conversion from Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-Alzheimer's disease (AD). Progression of a slowly progressing disease such as AD benefits from the use of longitudinal data; however, research till now is limited due to the insufficient patient data and short follow-up time. A small dataset size invalidates the estimation of underlying disease progression model; hence, a supervised nonparametric method is proposed. While depicting a real-world setting, longitudinal data of three years are employed for training, whereas only the baseline visit's data is used for validation. The train set is preprocessed for extraction of two dense clusters representing the subjects who remain stable at MCI or progress to AD after three years of the baseline visit. Similarity between these clusters and the test point is calculated in Euclidean space. Multiple features from two modalities of biomarkers, i.e., neuropsychological measures (NM) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry are also analyzed. Due to the limited MCI dataset size (NM: 145, MRI: 52, NM+MRI: 29), leave-one-out cross validation setup is employed for performance evaluation. The algorithm performance is noted for both unimodal case and bimodal cases. Superior performance (accuracy: 89.66{\%}, sensitivity: 87.50{\%}, specificity: 92.31{\%}, precision: 93.33{\%}) is delivered by multivariate predictors. Three notable conclusions of this study are: 1) Longitudinal data are more powerful than the temporal data, 2) MRI is a better predictor of MCI-to-AD conversion than NM, and 3) multivariate predictors outperform single predictor models.},

MCI participants that converted to AD (average follow-up 15??months) displayed significantly lower volumes in a number of grey matter (GM) regions, as well as in the white matter (WM). They also displayed more pronounced periventricular small-vessel pathology, as well as an increased rate of increase of such pathology. Individual person analysis was performed using a pattern classifier previously constructed from AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) individuals to yield an abnormality score that is positive for AD-like brains and negative otherwise. The abnormality scores measured from MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) followed a bimodal distribution, reflecting the heterogeneity of this group, whereas they were positive in almost all MCI converters (MCI-C), indicating extensive patterns of AD-like brain atrophy in almost all MCI-C. Both MCI subgroups had similar MMSE scores at baseline. A more specialized classifier constructed to differentiate converters from non-converters based on their baseline scans provided good classification accuracy reaching 81.5{\%}, evaluated via cross-validation. These pattern classification schemes, which distill spatial patterns of atrophy to a single abnormality score, offer promise as biomarkers of AD and as predictors of subsequent clinical progression, on an individual patient basis. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the effective treatment of AD, it would be important to identify MCI patients at high risk for conversion to AD. In this study, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion from one to three years before the clinical diagnosis. First, we developed a novel MRI biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion using semi-supervised learning and then integrated it with age and cognitive measures about the subjects using a supervised learning algorithm resulting in what we call the aggregate biomarker. The novel characteristics of the methods for learning the biomarkers are as follows: 1) We used a semi-supervised learning method (low density separation) for the construction of MRI biomarker as opposed to more typical supervised methods; 2) We performed a feature selection on MRI data from AD subjects and normal controls without using data from MCI subjects via regularized logistic regression; 3) We removed the aging effects from the MRI data before the classifier training to prevent possible confounding between AD and age related atrophies; and 4) We constructed the aggregate biomarker by first learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining it with age and cognitive measures about the MCI subjects at the baseline by applying a random forest classifier. We experimentally demonstrated the added value of these novel characteristics in predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion on data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. With the ADNI data, the MRI biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7661 in discriminating progressive MCI patients (pMCI) from stable MCI patients (sMCI). Our aggregate biomarker based on MRI data together with baseline cognitive measurements and age achieved a 10-fold cross-validated AUC score of 0.9020 in discriminating pMCI from sMCI. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of the suggested approach for early AD diagnosis and an important role of MRI in the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. However, it is evident based on our results that combining MRI data with cognitive test results improved the accuracy of the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction.},

abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Early prediction of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is important for timely therapeutic intervention and identifying participants for clinical trials at greater risk of developing AD. Methods to predict incipient AD in MCI have mostly utilized cross-sectional data. Longitudinal data enables estimation of the rate of change of variables, which along with the variable levels have been shown to improve prediction power. While some efforts have already been made in this direction, all previous longitudinal studies have been based on observation periods longer than one year, hence limiting their practical utility. It remains to be seen if follow-up evaluations within shorter intervals can significantly improve the accuracy of prediction in this problem. Our aim was to determine the added value of incorporating 6-month longitudinal data for predicting progression from MCI to AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 6-months longitudinal data from 247 participants with MCI, we trained two Random Forest classifiers to distinguish between progressive MCI (n=162) and stable MCI (n=85) cases. These models utilized structural MRI, neurocognitive assessments, and demographic information. The first model (cross-sectional) only used baseline data. The second model (longitudinal) used data from both baseline and a 6-month follow-up evaluation allowing the model to additionally incorporate biomarkers' rate of change. RESULTS: The longitudinal model (AUC=0.87; accuracy=80.2{\%}) performed significantly better (P{\textless}0.05) than the cross-sectional model (AUC=0.82; accuracy=71.7{\%}). CONCLUSION: Short-term longitudinal assessments significantly enhance the performance of AD prediction models.},

In computational neuroimaging where the automated segmentation of brain structures is frequently used to quantify change, a highly accurate registration is necessary for motion correction of images taken in the same session, or across time in longitudinal studies where changes in the images can be expected. This paper, inspired by Nestares and Heeger (2000), presents a method based on robust statistics to register images in the presence of differences, such as jaw movement, differential MR distortions and true anatomical change. The approach we present guarantees inverse consistency (symmetry), can deal with different intensity scales and automatically estimates a sensitivity parameter to detect outlier regions in the images. The resulting registrations are highly accurate due to their ability to ignore outlier regions and show superior robustness with respect to noise, to intensity scaling and outliers when compared to state-of-the-art registration tools such as FLIRT (in FSL) or the coregistration tool in SPM. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Longitudinal image analysis has become increasingly important in clinical studies of normal aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools, to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework, based on unbiased, robust, within-subject template creation, for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points. We demonstrate that it is essential to treat all input images exactly the same as removing only interpolation asymmetries is not sufficient to remove processing bias. We successfully reduce variability and avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each time point with common information from the subject template. The presented results show a significant increase in precision and discrimination power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations; as such they hold great potential in clinical applications, e.g. allowing for smaller sample sizes or shorter trials to establish disease specific biomarkers or to quantify drug effects. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We investigate a local reparameterizaton technique for greatly reducing the variance of stochastic gradients for variational Bayesian inference (SGVB) of a posterior over model parameters, while retaining parallelizability. This local reparameterization translates uncertainty about global parameters into local noise that is independent across datapoints in the minibatch. Such parameterizations can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is inversely proportional to the minibatch size, generally leading to much faster convergence. Additionally, we explore a connection with dropout: Gaussian dropout objectives correspond to SGVB with local reparameterization, a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance. Our method allows inference of more flexibly parameterized posteriors; specifically, we propose variational dropout, a generalization of Gaussian dropout where the dropout rates are learned, often leading to better models. The method is demonstrated through several experiments.},

abstract = {We present BrainPainter, a software that automatically generates images of highlighted brain structures given a list of numbers corresponding to the output colours of each region. Compared to existing visualisation software (i.e. Freesurfer, SPM, 3D Slicer), BrainPainter has three key advantages: (1) it does not require the input data to be in a specialised format, allowing BrainPainter to be used in combination with any neuroimaging analysis tools, (2) it can visualise both cortical and subcortical structures and (3) it can be used to generate movies showing dynamic processes, e.g. propagation of pathology on the brain. We highlight three use cases where BrainPainter was used in existing neuroimaging studies: (1) visualisation of the degree of atrophy through interpolation along a user-defined gradient of colours, (2) visualisation of the progression of pathology in Alzheimer's disease as well as (3) visualisation of pathology in subcortical regions in Huntington's disease. Moreover, through the design of BrainPainter we demonstrate the possibility of using a powerful 3D computer graphics engine such as Blender to generate brain visualisations for the neuroscience community. Blender's capabilities, e.g. particle simulations, motion graphics, UV unwrapping, raster graphics editing, raytracing and illumination effects, open a wealth of possibilities for brain visualisation not available in current neuroimaging software. BrainPainter (Source code: https://github.com/mrazvan22/brain-coloring) is customisable, easy to use, and can run straight from the web browser: http://brainpainter.csail.mit.edu. It can be used to visualise biomarker data from any brain imaging modality, or simply to highlight a particular brain structure for e.g. anatomy courses.},

@article{Cao2019,
abstract = {Canonical Correlation Analysis is a technique in multivariate data analysis for finding linear projections that maximize the correlation between two groups of variables. The correlations are typically defined without accounting for the serial correlations between observations, a typical setting for time series data. To understand the coupling dynamics and temporal variations between the two time-varying sources, we introduce the time-dependent canonical correlation analysis (TDCCA), a method for inferring time-dependent canonical vectors from multilevel time series data. A convex formulation of the problem is proposed, which leverages the singular value decomposition (SVD) characterization of all solutions of the CCA problem. We use simulated datasets to validate the proposed algorithm. Moreover, we propose a novel measure, canonical correlation variation as another way to assess the dynamic pattern of brain connections and we apply it to a real resting state fMRI dataset to study the aging effects on brain connectivity. Additionally, we explore our proposed method in a task-related fMRI to detect the temporal dynamics due to different motor tasks. We show that, compared to extant methods, the TDCCA-based approach not only detect temporal changes but also improves feature extraction. Together, this paper contributes broadly to new computational methodologies in understanding multilevel time series.},

@article{Sherstinsky2020,
abstract = {Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of “unrolling” an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the “Vanilla LSTM”1 network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.},

A total of 573 patients with MCI from the Swedish BioFINDER study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included in the study. The primary outcomes were longitudinal cognition and conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. A model combining tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181) and neurofilament light (NfL), but not A$\beta$42/A$\beta$40, had the best prognosis performance of all models (area under the curve = 0.88 for 4-year conversion to AD in BioFINDER, validated in ADNI), was stronger than a basic model of age, sex, education and baseline cognition, and performed similarly to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. A publicly available online tool for individualized prognosis in MCI based on our combined plasma biomarker models is introduced. Combination of plasma biomarkers may be of high value to identify individuals with MCI who will progress to AD dementia in clinical trials and in clinical practice. This study shows that combinations of blood-based biomarkers can be used to predict cognitive decline and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Biomarkers for tau and neurodegeneration provided accurate prognosis of decline and conversion over four years.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) measured in blood plasma has recently been proposed as an accessible, scalable, and highly specific biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal studies, however, investigating the temporal dynamics of this novel biomarker are lacking. It is therefore unclear when in the disease process plasma p-tau181 increases above physiological levels and how it relates to the spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's disease characteristic pathologies. We aimed to establish the natural time course of plasma p-tau181 across the sporadic Alzheimer's disease spectrum in comparison to those of established imaging and fluid-derived biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. We examined longitudinal data from a large prospective cohort of elderly individuals enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n = 1067) covering a wide clinical spectrum from normal cognition to dementia, and with measures of plasma p-tau181 and an 18F-florbetapir amyloid-$\beta$ PET scan at baseline. A subset of participants (n = 864) also had measures of amyloid-$\beta$1–42 and p-tau181 levels in CSF, and another subset (n = 298) had undergone an 18F-flortaucipir tau PET scan 6 years later. We performed brain-wide analyses to investigate the associations of plasma p-tau181 baseline levels and longitudinal change with progression of regional amyloid-$\beta$ pathology and tau burden 6 years later, and estimated the time course of changes in plasma p-tau181 and other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers using a previously developed method for the construction of long-term biomarker temporal trajectories using shorter-term longitudinal data. Smoothing splines demonstrated that earliest plasma p-tau181 changes occurred even before amyloid-$\beta$ markers reached abnormal levels, with greater rates of change correlating with increased amyloid-$\beta$ pathology. Voxel-wise PET analyses yielded relatively weak, yet significant, associations of plasma p-tau181 with amyloid-$\beta$ pathology in early accumulating brain regions in cognitively healthy individuals, while the strongest associations with amyloid-$\beta$ were observed in late accumulating regions in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Cross-sectional and particularly longitudinal measures of plasma p-tau181 were associated with widespread cortical tau aggregation 6 years later, covering temporoparietal regions typical for neurofibrillary tangle distribution in Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we estimated that plasma p-tau181 reaches abnormal levels ∼6.5 and 5.7 years after CSF and PET measures of amyloid-$\beta$, respectively, following similar dynamics as CSF p-tau181. Our findings suggest that plasma p-tau181 increases are associated with the presence of widespread cortical amyloid-$\beta$ pathology and with prospective Alzheimer's disease typical tau aggregation, providing clear implications for the use of this novel blood biomarker as a diagnostic and screening tool for Alzheimer's disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88{\%}.

@article{Oxtoby2017,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW This article argues that the time is approaching for data-driven disease modelling to take centre stage in the study and management of neurodegenerative disease. The snowstorm of data now available to the clinician defies qualitative evaluation; the heterogeneity of data types complicates integration through traditional statistical methods; and the large datasets becoming available remain far from the big-data sizes necessary for fully data-driven machine-learning approaches. The recent emergence of data-driven disease progression models provides a balance between imposed knowledge of disease features and patterns learned from data. The resulting models are both predictive of disease progression in individual patients and informative in terms of revealing underlying biological patterns. RECENT FINDINGS Largely inspired by observational models, data-driven disease progression models have emerged in the last few years as a feasible means for understanding the development of neurodegenerative diseases. These models have revealed insights into frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and other conditions. For example, event-based models have revealed finer graded understanding of progression patterns; self-modelling regression and differential equation models have provided data-driven biomarker trajectories; spatiotemporal models have shown that brain shape changes, for example of the hippocampus, can occur before detectable neurodegeneration; and network models have provided some support for prion-like mechanistic hypotheses of disease propagation. The most mature results are in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, in large part because of the availability of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative dataset. Results generally support the prevailing amyloid-led hypothetical model of Alzheimer's disease, while revealing finer detail and insight into disease progression. SUMMARY The emerging field of disease progression modelling provides a natural mechanism to integrate different kinds of information, for example from imaging, serum and cerebrospinal fluid markers and cognitive tests, to obtain new insights into progressive diseases. Such insights include fine-grained longitudinal patterns of neurodegeneration, from early stages, and the heterogeneity of these trajectories over the population. More pragmatically, such models enable finer precision in patient staging and stratification, prediction of progression rates and earlier and better identification of at-risk individuals. We argue that this will make disease progression modelling invaluable for recruitment and end-points in future clinical trials, potentially ameliorating the high failure rate in trials of, e.g., Alzheimer's disease therapies. We review the state of the art in these techniques and discuss the future steps required to translate the ideas to front-line application.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

abstract = {Neuroimaging has made it possible to measure pathological brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo. Over the past decade, these measures have been increasingly integrated into imaging signatures of AD by means of classification frameworks, offering promising tools for individualized diagnosis and prognosis. We reviewed neuroimaging-based studies for AD and mild cognitive impairment classification, selected after online database searches in Google Scholar and PubMed (January, 1985–June, 2016). We categorized these studies based on the following neuroimaging modalities (and sub-categorized based on features extracted as a post-processing step from these modalities): i) structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] (tissue density, cortical surface, and hippocampal measurements), ii) functional MRI (functional coherence of different brain regions, and the strength of the functional connectivity), iii) diffusion tensor imaging (patterns along the white matter fibers), iv) fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (metabolic rate of cerebral glucose), and v) amyloid-PET (amyloid burden). The studies reviewed indicate that the classification frameworks formulated on the basis of these features show promise for individualized diagnosis and prediction of clinical progression.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use serial imaging to gain insight into the sequence of pathologic events in Alzheimer's disease, and the clinical features associated with this sequence. We measured change in amyloid deposition over time using serial (11)C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography and progression of neurodegeneration using serial structural magnetic resonance imaging. We studied 21 healthy cognitively normal subjects, 32 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 8 with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were drawn from two sources--ongoing longitudinal registries at Mayo Clinic, and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). All subjects underwent clinical assessments, MRI and PIB studies at two time points, approximately one year apart. PIB retention was quantified in global cortical to cerebellar ratio units and brain atrophy in units of cm(3) by measuring ventricular expansion. The annual change in global PIB retention did not differ by clinical group (P = 0.90), and although small (median 0.042 ratio units/year overall) was greater than zero among all subjects (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.001). Ventricular expansion rates differed by clinical group (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.001) and increased in the following order: cognitively normal (1.3 cm(3)/year) {\{}{\textless}{\}} amnestic mild cognitive impairment (2.5 cm(3)/year) {\{}{\textless}{\}} Alzheimer's disease (7.7 cm(3)/year). Among all subjects there was no correlation between PIB change and concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = -0.01, P = 0.97) but some evidence of a weak correlation with MMSE (r =-0.22, P = 0.09). In contrast, greater rates of ventricular expansion were clearly correlated with worsening concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = 0.42, P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.01) and MMSE (r =-0.52, P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.01). Our data are consistent with a model of typical late onset Alzheimer's disease that has two main features: (i) dissociation between the rate of amyloid deposition and the rate of neurodegeneration late in life, with amyloid deposition proceeding at a constant slow rate while neurodegeneration accelerates and (ii) clinical symptoms are coupled to neurodegeneration not amyloid deposition. Significant plaque deposition occurs prior to clinical decline. The presence of brain amyloidosis alone is not sufficient to produce cognitive decline, rather, the neurodegenerative component of Alzheimer's disease pathology is the direct substrate of cognitive impairment and the rate of cognitive decline is driven by the rate of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration (atrophy on MRI) both precedes and parallels cognitive decline. This model implies a complimentary role for MRI and PIB imaging in Alzheimer's disease, with each reflecting one of the major pathologies, amyloid dysmetabolism and neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Currently available evidence strongly supports the position that the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to abnormal processing of $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) peptide, ultimately leading to formation of A$\beta$ plaques in the brain. This process occurs while individuals are still cognitively normal. Biomarkers of brain $\beta$-amyloidosis are reductions in CSF A$\beta$42and increased amyloid PET tracer retention. After a lag period, which varies from patient to patient, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the dominant pathological processes. Biomarkers of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration are increased CSF tau and structural MRI measures of cerebral atrophy. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction, which is indicated by decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET. We propose a model that relates disease stage to AD biomarkers in which A$\beta$ biomarkers become abnormal first, before neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognitive symptoms, and neurodegenerative biomarkers become abnormal later, and correlate with clinical symptom severity. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records.

The method utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for classification with several feature extraction techniques. MRI is a non-invasive procedure, widely adopted in hospitals to examine cognitive abnormalities. Images are acquired using the T2 imaging sequence. The paradigm consists of a series of quantitative techniques: filtering, feature extraction, Student's t-test based feature selection, and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) based classification. Additionally, a comparative analysis is done by implementing other feature extraction procedures that are described in the literature. Our findings suggest that the Shearlet Transform (ST) feature extraction technique offers improved results for Alzheimer's diagnosis as compared to alternative methods. The proposed CABD tool with the ST + KNN technique provided accuracy of 94.54{\%}, precision of 88.33{\%}, sensitivity of 96.30{\%} and specificity of 93.64{\%}. Furthermore, this tool also offered an accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity of 98.48{\%}, 100{\%}, 96.97{\%} and 100{\%}, respectively, with the benchmark MRI database.},

abstract = {Computational models predicting symptomatic progression at the individual level can be highly beneficial for early intervention and treatment planning for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individual prognosis is complicated by many factors including the definition of the prediction objective itself. In this work, we present a computational framework comprising machine-learning techniques for 1) modeling symptom trajectories and 2) prediction of symptom trajectories using multimodal and longitudinal data. We perform primary analyses on three cohorts from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and a replication analysis using subjects from Australian Imaging, Biomarker {\&} Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). We model the prototypical symptom trajectory classes using clinical assessment scores from mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-13) at nine timepoints spanned over six years based on a hierarchical clustering approach. Subsequently we predict these trajectory classes for a given subject using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, genetic, and clinical variables from two timepoints (baseline + follow-up). For prediction, we present a longitudinal Siamese neural-network (LSN) with novel architectural modules for combining multimodal data from two timepoints. The trajectory modeling yields two (stable and decline) and three (stable, slow-decline, fast-decline) trajectory classes for MMSE and ADAS-13 assessments, respectively. For the predictive tasks, LSN offers highly accurate performance with 0.900 accuracy and 0.968 AUC for binary MMSE task and 0.760 accuracy for 3-way ADAS-13 task on ADNI datasets, as well as, 0.724 accuracy and 0.883 AUC for binary MMSE task on replication AIBL dataset.},

The use of EEG as a tool for AD diagnosis has been widely studied by comparing EEG signals of AD patients only to those of healthy subjects. By contrast, we perform automated EEG diagnosis in a differential diagnosis context using a new database, acquired in clinical conditions, which contains EEG data of 169 patients: subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, possible Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and patients with other pathologies. We show that two EEG features, namely epoch-based entropy (a measure of signal complexity) and bump modeling (a measure of synchrony) are sufficient for efficient discrimination between these groups. We studied the performance of our methodology for the automatic discrimination of possible AD patients from SCI patients and from patients with MCI or other pathologies. A classification accuracy of 91.6{\%} (specificity = 100{\%}, sensitivity = 87.8{\%}) was obtained when discriminating SCI patients from possible AD patients and 81.8{\%} to 88.8{\%} accuracy was obtained for the 3-class classification of SCI, possible AD and other patients.},

abstract = {Longitudinal designs are widely used in medical studies as a means of observing within-subject changes over time in groups of subjects, thereby aiming to improve sensitivity for detecting disease effects. Paralleling an increased use of such studies in neuroimaging has been the adoption of pattern recognition algorithms for making individualized predictions of disease. However, at present few pattern recognition methods exist to make full use of neuroimaging data that have been collected longitudinally, with most methods relying instead on cross-sectional style analysis. This article presents a principal component analysis-based feature construction method that uses longitudinal high-dimensional data to improve predictive performance of pattern recognition algorithms. The method can be applied to data from a wide range of longitudinal study designs and permits an arbitrary number of time-points per subject. We apply the method to two longitudinal datasets, one containing subjects with mild cognitive impairment along with healthy controls, the other with early dementia subjects and healthy controls. Across both datasets, we show improvements in predictive accuracy relative to cross-sectional classifiers for discriminating disease subjects from healthy controls on the basis of whole-brain structural magnetic resonance image-based voxels. In addition, we can transfer longitudinal information from one set of subjects to make disease predictions in another set of subjects. The proposed method is simple and, as a feature construction method, flexible with respect to the choice of classifier and image registration algorithm. Hum Brain Mapp 37:4385-4404, 2016.

These subjects are at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and biomarkers are needed to predict their cognitive deterioration. Here we used relevance vector regression (RVR), a pattern-recognition method, to predict concurrent cognitive decline on the basis of longitudinal gray matter (GM) changes, within two a priori, meta-analytically defined functional networks subserving episodic memory and executive function. Ninety-six HC subjects were assessed annually for three years with structural MRI and cognitive tests within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Presence of abnormal biomarker values of Abeta (Abeta+) were determined with cerebrospinal fluid and amyloid-PET (HC-Abeta+, n=30; with n=66 for normal HC-Abeta-). Using leave-one-out cross-validation, we found that in HC-Abeta+ patterns of GM changes within both networks predicted decline in episodic memory (r=0.61, p{\textless}0.001; r=0.40, p=0.03), but not executive function. In HC-Abeta-, GM changes within the executive function network predicted decline in executive function (r=0.44, p{\textless}0.001). Previously established region-of-interest (ROI)-based predictors such as changes in hippocampal volume, within an AD-signature multi-ROI, or total GM volume were not predictive of cognitive decline in any group or cognitive domain. RVR analyses unrestricted to the a priori networks yielded compatible results with the restricted case. In conclusion, RVR-derived patterns of subtle cortical GM changes are biomarker candidates of concurrent cognitive decline in aging and subjects at risk for AD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage from normal aging to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. It is extremely important to develop criteria that can be used to separate the MCI subjects at imminent risk of conversion to Alzheimer-type dementia from those who would remain stable. We have developed an automatic algorithm for computing a novel measure of hippocampal volumetric integrity (HVI) from structural MRI scans that may be useful for this purpose. OBJECTIVE To determine the utility of HVI in classification between stable and progressive MCI patients using the Random Forest classification algorithm. METHODS We used a 16-dimensional feature space including bilateral HVI obtained from baseline and one-year follow-up structural MRI, cognitive tests, and genetic and demographic information to train a Random Forest classifier in a sample of 164 MCI subjects categorized into two groups [progressive (n = 86) or stable (n = 78)] based on future conversion (or lack thereof) of their diagnosis to probable AD. RESULTS The overall accuracy of classification was estimated to be 82.3{\%} (86.0{\%} sensitivity, 78.2{\%} specificity). The accuracy in women (89.1{\%}) was considerably higher than that in men (78.9{\%}). The prediction accuracy achieved in women is the highest reported in any previous application of machine learning to AD diagnosis in MCI. CONCLUSION The method presented in this paper can be used to separate stable MCI patients from those who are at early stages of AD dementia with high accuracy. There may be stronger indicators of imminent AD dementia in women with MCI as compared to men.},

abstract = {The literature on cognitive markers in preclinical AD is reviewed. The findings demonstrate that impairment in multiple cognitive domains is typically observed several years before clinical diagnosis. Measures of executive functioning, episodic memory and perceptual speed appear to be most effective at identifying at-risk individuals. The fact that these cognitive domains are most implicated in normal cognitive aging suggests that the cognitive deficit observed preclinically is not qualitatively different from that observed in normal aging. The degree of cognitive impairment prior to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to generalize relatively well across major study characteristics, including sample ascertainment procedures, age and cognitive status of participants, as well as time to diagnosis of dementia. In episodic memory, there is evidence that the size of the preclinical deficit increases with increasing cognitive demands. The global cognitive impairment observed is highly consistent with observations that multiple brain structures and functions are affected long before the diagnosis of AD. However, there is substantial overlap in the distribution of cognitive scores between those who will and those who will not be diagnosed with AD, hence limiting the clinical utility of cognitive markers for early identification of cases. Future research should consider combining cognitive indicators with other types of markers (i.e. social, somatic, genetic, brain-based) in order to increase prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {An estimated 24 million people worldwide have dementia, the majority of whom are thought to have Alzheimer's disease. Thus, Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health concern and has been identified as a research priority. Although there are licensed treatments that can alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of pathogenesis to enable development of disease-modifying treatments. Methods for improving diagnosis are also moving forward, but a better consensus is needed for development of a panel of biological and neuroimaging biomarkers that support clinical diagnosis. There is now strong evidence of potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive decline, but further work is needed to understand these better and to establish whether interventions can substantially lower these risks. In this Seminar, we provide an overview of recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and discuss potential ways to reduce the risk of developing the disease. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The order and magnitude of pathologic processes in Alzheimer's disease are not well understood, partly because the disease develops over many years. Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease has a predictable age at onset and provides an opportunity to determine the sequence and magnitude of pathologic changes that culminate in symptomatic disease. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study, we analyzed data from 128 participants who underwent baseline clinical and cognitive assessments, brain imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood tests. We used the participant's age at baseline assessment and the parent's age at the onset of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to calculate the estimated years from expected symptom onset (age of the participant minus parent's age at symptom onset). We conducted cross-sectional analyses of baseline data in relation to estimated years from expected symptom onset in order to determine the relative order and magnitude of pathophysiological changes. RESULTS: Concentrations of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$)(42) in the CSF appeared to decline 25 years before expected symptom onset. A$\beta$ deposition, as measured by positron-emission tomography with the use of Pittsburgh compound B, was detected 15 years before expected symptom onset. Increased concentrations of tau protein in the CSF and an increase in brain atrophy were detected 15 years before expected symptom onset. Cerebral hypometabolism and impaired episodic memory were observed 10 years before expected symptom onset. Global cognitive impairment, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, was detected 5 years before expected symptom onset, and patients met diagnostic criteria for dementia at an average of 3 years after expected symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: We found that autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease was associated with a series of pathophysiological changes over decades in CSF biochemical markers of Alzheimer's disease, brain amyloid deposition, and brain metabolism as well as progressive cognitive impairment. Our results require confirmation with the use of longitudinal data and may not apply to patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease.

We regard brain neurons as a continuous medium, and structure them by their degree of malfunctioning. Two different mechanisms are assumed to be relevant for the temporal evolution of the disease: i) diffusion and agglomeration of soluble polymers of amyloid, produced by damaged neurons; ii) neuron-to-neuron prion-like transmission. We model these two processes by a system of Smoluchowski equations for the amyloid concentration, coupled to a kinetic-type transport equation for the distribution function of the degree of malfunctioning of neurons. The second equation contains an integral term describing the random onset of the disease as a jump process localised in particularly sensitive areas of the brain. Our numerical simulations are in good qualitative agreement with clinical images of the disease distribution in the brain which vary from early to advanced stages.},

Methods We characterized the temporal trajectories of measures of verbal episodic memory, short-term visual memory, and mental status using data from 895 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Results The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) immediate recall was the first measure to decline, followed by CVLT delayed recall. However, further along the disease progression scale, CVLT delayed recall and visual memory changed more rapidly than CVLT immediate recall. Conclusions Our findings reconcile reports of early changes in immediate recall with greater reliance on delayed recall performance in clinical settings. Moreover, the utility of cognitive markers in evaluating AD progression depends on the stage of cognitive decline, suggesting that optimal endpoints in therapeutic trials may vary across different stages of the disease process.},

abstract = {Abstract. Cortical $\beta$-amyloid deposition begins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) years before the onset of any clinical symptoms. It is therefore important to determine the temporal trajectories of amyloid deposition in these earliest stages in order to better understand their associations with progression to AD. A method for estimating the temporal trajectories of voxelwise amyloid as measured using longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is presented. The method involves the estimation of a score for each subject visit based on the PET data that reflects their amyloid progression. This amyloid progression score allows subjects with similar progressions to be aligned and analyzed together. The estimation of the progression scores and the amyloid trajectory parameters are performed using an expectation-maximization algorithm. The correlations among the voxel measures of amyloid are modeled to reflect the spatial nature of PET images. Simulation results show that model parameters are captured well at a variety of noise and spatial correlation levels. The method is applied to longitudinal amyloid imaging data considering each cerebral hemisphere separately. The results are consistent across the hemispheres and agree with a global index of brain amyloid known as mean cortical DVR. Unlike mean cortical DVR, which depends on a priori defined regions, the progression score extracted by the method is data-driven and does not make assumptions about regional longitudinal changes. Compared to regressing on age at each voxel, the longitudinal trajectory slopes estimated using the proposed method show better localized longitudinal changes.},

abstract = {Investigation of the temporal trajectories of currently used neuropsychological tests is critical to identifying earliest changing measures on the path to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used the Progression Score (PS) method to characterize the temporal trajectories of measures of verbal memory, executive function, attention, processing speed, language, and mental state using data spanning normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD from 1661 participants with a total of 7839 visits (age at last visit 77.6 SD 9.2) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and 1542 participants with a total of 4467 visits (age at last visit 59.9 SD 7.3) in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention. This method aligns individuals in time based on the similarity of their longitudinal measurements to reveal temporal trajectories. As a validation of our methodology, we explored the associations between the individualized cognitive progression scores (Cog‑PS) computed by our method and clinical diagnosis. Digit span tests were the first to show declines in both data sets, and were detected mainly among cognitively normal individuals. These were followed by tests of verbal memory, which were in turn followed by Trail Making Tests, Boston Naming Test, and Mini-Mental State Examination. Differences in Cog-PS across the clinical diagnosis groups were statistically significant, highlighting the potential use of Cog-PS as individualized indicators of disease progression. Identifying cognitive measures that are changing in preclinical AD can lead to the development of novel cognitive tests that are finely tuned to detecting earliest changes.},

abstract = {It is important to characterize the temporal trajectories of disease-related biomarkers in order to monitor progression and identify potential points of intervention. These are especially important for neurodegenerative diseases, as therapeutic intervention is most likely to be effective in the preclinical disease stages prior to significant neuronal damage. Neuroimaging allows for the measurement of structural, functional, and metabolic integrity of the brain at the level of voxels, whose volumes are on the order of mm(3). These voxelwise measurements provide a rich collection of disease indicators. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies enable the analysis of changes in these voxelwise measures. However, commonly used longitudinal analysis approaches, such as linear mixed effects models, do not account for the fact that individuals enter a study at various disease stages and progress at different rates, and generally consider each voxelwise measure independently. We propose a multivariate nonlinear mixed effects model for estimating the trajectories of voxelwise neuroimaging biomarkers from longitudinal data that accounts for such differences across individuals. The method involves the prediction of a progression score for each visit based on a collective analysis of voxelwise biomarker data within an expectation-maximization framework that efficiently handles large amounts of measurements and variable number of visits per individual, and accounts for spatial correlations among voxels. This score allows individuals with similar progressions to be aligned and analyzed together, which enables the construction of a trajectory of brain changes as a function of an underlying progression or disease stage. We apply our method to studying cortical beta-amyloid deposition, a hallmark of preclinical Alzheimer's disease, as measured using positron emission tomography. Results on 104 individuals with a total of 300 visits suggest that precuneus is the earliest cortical region to accumulate amyloid, closely followed by the cingulate and frontal cortices, then by the lateral parietal cortex. The extracted progression scores reveal a pattern similar to mean cortical distribution volume ratio (DVR), an index of global brain amyloid levels. The proposed method can be applied to other types of longitudinal imaging data, including metabolism, blood flow, tau, and structural imaging-derived measures, to extract individualized summary scores indicating disease progression and to provide voxelwise trajectories that can be compared between brain regions.},

The method allows to compute an average spatiotemporal trajectory of shape changes at the group level, and the individual variations of this trajectory both in terms of geometry and time dynamics. First, we formulate a non-linear mixed-effects statistical model as the combination of a generic statistical model for manifold-valued longitudinal data, a deformation model defining shape trajectories via the action of a finite-dimensional set of diffeomorphisms with a manifold structure, and an efficient numerical scheme to compute parallel transport on this manifold. Second, we introduce a MCMC-SAEM algorithm with a specific approach to shape sampling, an adaptive scheme for proposal variances, and a log-likelihood tempering strategy to estimate our model. Third, we validate our algorithm on 2D simulated data, and then estimate a scenario of alteration of the shape of the hippocampus 3D brain structure during the course of Alzheimer's disease. The method shows for instance that hippocampal atrophy progresses more quickly in female subjects, and occurs earlier in APOE4 mutation carriers. We finally illustrate the potential of our method for classifying pathological trajectories versus normal ageing.},

abstract = {Early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), while still at the stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is important for the development of new treatments. However, brain degeneration in MCI evolves with time and differs from patient to patient, making early diagnosis a very challenging task. Despite these difficulties, many machine learning techniques have already been used for the diagnosis of MCI and for predicting MCI to AD conversion, but the MCI group used in previous works is usually very heterogeneous containing subjects at different stages. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the disease stage impacts on the ability of machine learning methodologies to predict conversion. After identifying the converters and estimating the time of conversion (TC) (using neuropsychological test scores), we devised 5 subgroups of MCI converters (MCI-C) based on their temporal distance to the conversion instant (0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months before conversion). Next, we used the FDG-PET images of these subgroups and trained classifiers to distinguish between the MCI-C at different stages and stable non-converters (MCI-NC). Our results show that MCI to AD conversion can be predicted as early as 24 months prior to conversion and that the discriminative power of the machine learning methods decreases with the increasing temporal distance to the TC, as expected. These findings were consistent for all the tested classifiers. Our results also show that this decrease arises from a reduction in the information contained in the regions used for classification and by a decrease in the stability of the automatic selection procedure.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The main goal of this work is to investigate the feasibility of estimating an anatomical index that can be used as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factor in the Women's Health Initiative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study (WHIMS-MRI) using MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a well-characterized imaging database of AD patients and cognitively normal subjects. We called this index AD Pattern Similarity (AD-PS) scores. To demonstrate the construct validity of the scores, we investigated their associations with several AD risk factors. The ADNI and WHIMS imaging databases were collected with different goals, populations and data acquisition protocols: it is important to demonstrate that the approach to estimating AD-PS scores can bridge these differences. METHODS: MRI data from both studies were processed using high-dimensional warping methods. High-dimensional classifiers were then estimated using the ADNI MRI data. Next, the classifiers were applied to baseline and follow-up WHIMS-MRI GM data to generate the GM AD-PS scores. To study the validity of the scores we investigated associations between GM AD-PS scores at baseline (Scan 1) and their longitudinal changes (Scan 2 -Scan 1) with: 1) age, cognitive scores, white matter small vessel ischemic disease (WM SVID) volume at baseline and 2) age, cognitive scores, WM SVID volume longitudinal changes respectively. In addition, we investigated their associations with time until classification of independently adjudicated status in WHIMS-MRI. RESULTS: Higher GM AD-PS scores from WHIMS-MRI baseline data were associated with older age, lower cognitive scores, and higher WM SVID volume. Longitudinal changes in GM AD-PS scores (Scan 2 - Scan 1) were also associated with age and changes in WM SVID volumes and cognitive test scores. Increases in the GM AD-PS scores predicted decreases in cognitive scores and increases in WM SVID volume. GM AD-PS scores and their longitudinal changes also were associated with time until classification of cognitive impairment. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curves showed that baseline GM AD-PS scores of cognitively normal participants carried information about future cognitive status determined during follow-up. DISCUSSION: We applied a high-dimensional machine learning approach to estimate a novel AD risk factor for WHIMS-MRI study participants using ADNI data. The GM AD-PS scores showed strong associations with incident cognitive impairment and cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with age, cognitive function, cognitive status and WM SVID volume lending support to the ongoing validation of the GM AD-PS score.},

We validated our approach by analyzing a simulated atrophy study, and found that this approach requires only a small number of samples to detect the ground-truth temporal model. We further applied dynamic Bayesian network modeling to a longitudinal study of normal aging and mild cognitive impairment--the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We found that interactions among regional volume-change rates for the mild cognitive impairment group are different from those for the normal-aging group.},

abstract = {Recent technological advances have made it possible for many studies to collect high dimensional data (HDD) longitudinally, for example, images collected during different scanning sessions. Such studies may yield temporal changes of selected features that, when incorporated with machine learning methods, are able to predict disease status or responses to a therapeutic treatment. Support vector machine (SVM) techniques are robust and effective tools well suited for the classification and prediction of HDD. However, current SVM methods for HDD analysis typically consider cross-sectional data collected during one time period or session (e.g., baseline). We propose a novel support vector classifier (SVC) for longitudinal HDD that allows simultaneous estimation of the SVM separating hyperplane parameters and temporal trend parameters, which determine the optimal means to combine the longitudinal data for classification and prediction. Our approach is based on an augmented reproducing kernel function and uses quadratic programming for optimization. We demonstrate the use and potential advantages of our proposed methodology using a simulation study and a data example from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The results indicate that our proposed method leverages the additional longitudinal information to achieve higher accuracy than methods using only cross-sectional data and methods that combine longitudinal data by naively expanding the feature space.},

abstract = {Predicting disease risk and progression is one of the main goals in many clinical research studies. Cohort studies on the natural history and etiology of chronic diseases span years and data are collected at multiple visits. Although, kernel-based statistical learning methods are proven to be powerful for a wide range of disease prediction problems, these methods are only well studied for independent data, but not for longitudinal data. It is thus important to develop time-sensitive prediction rules that make use of the longitudinal nature of the data. In this paper, we develop a novel statistical learning method for longitudinal data by introducing subject-specific short-term and long-term latent effects through a designed kernel to account for within-subject correlation of longitudinal measurements. Since the presence of multiple sources of data is increasingly common, we embed our method in a multiple kernel learning framework and propose a regularized multiple kernel statistical learning with random effects to construct effective nonparametric prediction rules. Our method allows easy integration of various heterogeneous data sources and takes advantage of correlation among longitudinal measures to increase prediction power. We use different kernels for each data source taking advantage of the distinctive feature of each data modality, and then optimally combine data across modalities. We apply the developed methods to two large epidemiological studies, one on Huntington's disease and the other on Alzheimer's Disease (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI) where we explore a unique opportunity to combine imaging and genetic data to study prediction of mild cognitive impairment, and show a substantial gain in performance while accounting for the longitudinal aspect of the data.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential clinical value of quantitative functional FDG PET and pathological amyloid-beta PET with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and clinical assessments in the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. METHODS: We studied 82 subjects for up to 96 months (median = 84 months) in a longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. All preprocessed PET images were spatially normalized to standard Montreal Neurologic Institute space. Regions of interest (ROI) were defined on MRI template, and standard uptake values ratios (SUVRs) to the cerebellum for FDG and amyloid-beta PET were calculated. Predictive values of single and multiparametric PET biomarkers with and without clinical assessments and CSF biomarkers for AD progression were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression model. RESULTS: The posterior precuneus and cingulate SUVRs were identified for both FDG and amyloid-beta PET in predicating progression in normal controls (NCs) and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). FDG parietal and lateral temporal SUVRs were suggested for monitoring NCs and MCI group progression, respectively. 18F-AV45 global cortex attained (78.6{\%}, 74.5{\%}, 75.4{\%}) (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) in predicting NC progression, which is comparable to the 11C-PiB global cortex SUVR's in predicting MCI to AD. A logistic regression model to combine FDG parietal and posterior precuneus SUVR and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) Total Mod was identified in predicating NC progression with (80.0{\%}, 94.9{\%}, 93.9{\%}) (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy). The selected model including FDG posterior cingulate SUVR, ADAS-Cog Total Mod, and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores for predicating MCI to AD attained (96.4{\%}, 81.2{\%}, 83.6{\%}) (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy). 11C-PiB medial temporal SUVR with MMSE significantly increased 11C-PiB PET AUC to 0.915 (p{\textless}0.05) in predicating MCI to AD with (77.8{\%}, 90.4{\%}, 88.5{\%}) (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy). CONCLUSION: Quantitative FDG and 11C-PiB PET with clinical cognitive assessments significantly improved accuracy in the predication of AD progression.},

abstract = {Prediction of onset and progression of cognitive decline and dementia is important both for understanding the underlying disease processes and for planning health care for populations at risk. Predictors identified in research studies are typically accessed at one point in time. In this manuscript, we argue that an accurate model for predicting cognitive status over relatively long periods requires inclusion of time-varying components that are sequentially assessed at multiple time points (e.g., in multiple follow-up visits). We developed a pilot model to test the feasibility of using either estimated or observed risk factors to predict cognitive status. We developed two models, the first using a sequential estimation of risk factors originally obtained from 8 years prior, then improved by optimization. This model can predict how cognition will change over relatively long time periods. The second model uses observed rather than estimated time-varying risk factors and, as expected, results in better prediction. This model can predict when newly observed data are acquired in a follow-up visit. Performances of both models that are evaluated in10-fold cross-validation and various patient subgroups show supporting evidence for these pilot models. Each model consists of multiple base prediction units (BPUs), which were trained using the same set of data. The difference in usage and function between the two models is the source of input data: either estimated or observed data. In the next step of model refinement, we plan to integrate the two types of data together to flexibly predict dementia status and changes over time, when some time-varying predictors are measured only once and others are measured repeatedly. Computationally, both data provide upper and lower bounds for predictive performance.},

The architecture of the network only relies on baseline PET studies of AD and normal subjects as the training dataset. Feature extraction and complicated image preprocessing including nonlinear warping are unnecessary for our approach. Accuracy of prediction (84.2{\%}) for conversion to AD in MCI patients outperformed conventional feature-based quantification approaches. ROC analyses revealed that performance of CNN-based approach was significantly higher than that of the conventional quantification methods (p {\textless}0.05). Output scores of the network were strongly correlated with the longitudinal change in cognitive measurements.

We applied that univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and multistep model selection for AD predictors including biomarkers. In univariate logistic analysis, we selected age, Rey Auditory Verbal Retention Test, parietal glucose metabolic rate, CSF total tau, and presence or not of at least one APOE epsilon4 allele as predictors. Through multivariate stepwise logistic analysis and model selection, we found the combination of parietal glucose metabolic rate and total tau representing the best model for AD prediction. In conclusion, our findings highlight that the combination of regional glucose metabolic assessment by PET and CSF biomarkers evaluation can significantly improve AD predictive diagnostic accuracy of each respective method.},

Baseline predictive values of all aforementioned indices were then compared using survival analysis on 381 MCI subjects. SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog were found to have similar predictive value, and their combination was significantly better than their individual performance. APOE genotype did not significantly improve prediction, although the combination of SPARE-AD, ADAS-Cog and APOE epsilon4 provided the highest hazard ratio estimates of 17.8 (last vs. first quartile). In a subset of 192 MCI patients who also had CSF biomarkers, the addition of Abeta1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p to the previous model did not improve predictive value significantly over SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog combined. Importantly, in amyloid-negative patients with MCI, SPARE-AD had high predictive power of clinical progression. Our findings suggest that SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog in combination offer the highest predictive power of conversion from MCI to AD, which is improved, albeit not significantly, by APOE genotype. The finding that SPARE-AD in amyloid-negative MCI patients was predictive of clinical progression is not expected under the amyloid hypothesis and merits further investigation.},

The SPARE-AD score, summarizing brain atrophy patterns, was tested as a predictor of short-term conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI individuals that converted to AD (MCI-C) had mostly positive baseline SPARE-AD (Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of Early AD) and atrophy in temporal lobe gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), posterior cingulate/precuneous, and insula. MCI individuals that converted to AD had mostly AD-like baseline CSF biomarkers.

Those MCI-NC with most negative baseline SPARE-AD scores (normal brain structure) had significantly higher baseline Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (28.67) than others, and relatively low annual rate of Mini Mental State Examination decrease (-0.25). MCI-NC with midlevel baseline SPARE-AD displayed faster annual rates of SPARE-AD increase (indicating progressing atrophy). SPARE-AD and CSF combination improved prediction over individual values. In summary, both SPARE-AD and CSF biomarkers showed high baseline sensitivity, however, many MCI-NC had abnormal baseline SPARE-AD and CSF biomarkers.

abstract = {A challenge in developing informative neuroimaging biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is the need to identify biomarkers that are evident before the onset of clinical symptoms, and which have sufficient sensitivity and specificity on an individual patient basis. Recent literature suggests that spatial patterns of brain atrophy discriminate amongst Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) older adults with high accuracy on an individual basis, thereby offering promise that subtle brain changes can be detected during prodromal Alzheimer's disease stages. Here, we investigate whether these spatial patterns of brain atrophy can be detected in CN and MCI individuals and whether they are associated with cognitive decline. Images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to construct a pattern classifier that recognizes spatial patterns of brain atrophy which best distinguish Alzheimer's disease patients from CN on an individual person basis. This classifier was subsequently applied to longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans of CN and MCI participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) neuroimaging study. The degree to which Alzheimer's disease-like patterns were present in CN and MCI subjects was evaluated longitudinally in relation to cognitive performance. The oldest BLSA CN individuals showed progressively increasing Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy, and individuals with these patterns had reduced cognitive performance. MCI was associated with steeper longitudinal increases of Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy, which separated them from CN (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve equal to 0.89). Our results suggest that imaging-based spatial patterns of brain atrophy of Alzheimer's disease, evaluated with sophisticated pattern analysis and recognition methods, may be useful in discriminating among CN individuals who are likely to be stable versus those who will show cognitive decline. Future prospective studies will elucidate the temporal dynamics of spatial atrophy patterns and the emergence of clinical symptoms.

abstract = {Longitudinal data are often plagued with sparsity of time points where measurements are available. The functional data analysis perspective has been shown to provide an effective and flexible approach to address this problem for the case where measurements are sparse but their times are randomly distributed over an interval. Here we focus on a different scenario where available data can be characterized as snippets, which are very short stretches of longitudinal measurements. For each subject the stretch of available data is much shorter than the time frame of interest, a common occurrence in accelerated longitudinal studies. An added challenge is introduced if a time proxy that is basic for usual longitudinal modeling is not available. This situation arises in the case of Alzheimer's disease and comparable scenarios, where one is interested in time dynamics of declining performance, but the time of disease onset is unknown and the chronological age does not provide a meaningful time reference for longitudinal modeling. Our main methodological contribution is to address this problem with a novel approach. Key quantities for our approach are conditional quantile trajectories for monotonic processes that emerge as solutions of a dynamic system, and for which we obtain uniformly consistent estimates. These trajectories are shown to be useful to describe processes that quantify deterioration over time, such as hippocampal volumes in Alzheimer's patients.},

The model enabled the estimation of a DOT and a disease trajectory for each patient. The model also allowed distinguishing fast and slow-progressing subpopulations according to the functional assessment questionnaire, normalized hippocampal volume, and CDR-SOB score at study entry. On the basis of these prognostic factors, 81{\%} of the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects could correctly be assigned to slow or fast progressers, and 77{\%} of MCI to AD conversions could be predicted whereas the model described correctly 84{\%} of the conversions. Finally, synchronization of the biomarker-time profiles on estimated individual DOT virtually expanded the population observation period from 3 to 8 years.

abstract = {Background: In the era of computer-assisted diagnostic tools for various brain diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) covers a large percentage of neuroimaging research, with the main scope being its use in daily practice. However, there has been no study attempting to simultaneously discriminate among Healthy Controls (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late MCI (cMCI) and stable AD, using features derived from a single modality, namely MRI. New method: Based on preprocessed MRI images from the organizers of a neuroimaging challenge,.33The preprocessing of the T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) was conducted by the organizers of the competition; information can be found here: https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/mci-prediction we attempted to quantify the prediction accuracy of multiple morphological MRI features to simultaneously discriminate among HC, MCI, cMCI and AD. We explored the efficacy of a novel scheme that includes multiple feature selections via Random Forest from subsets of the whole set of features (e.g. whole set, left/right hemisphere etc.), Random Forest classification using a fusion approach and ensemble classification via majority voting.From the ADNI database, 60 HC, 60 MCI, 60 cMCI and 60 CE were used as a training set with known labels. An extra dataset of 160 subjects (HC: 40, MCI: 40, cMCI: 40 and AD: 40) was used as an external blind validation dataset to evaluate the proposed machine learning scheme. Results: In the second blind dataset, we succeeded in a four-class classification of 61.9{\%} by combining MRI-based features with a Random Forest-based Ensemble Strategy. We achieved the best classification accuracy of all teams that participated in this neuroimaging competition. Comparison with existing method(s): The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to simultaneously discriminate among four groups using morphological MRI features for the very first time in the literature. Conclusions: Hence, the proposed machine learning scheme can be used to define single and multi-modal biomarkers for AD.},

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) follows elders with various degrees of cognitive impairment, from normal to impaired. The study includes a rich panel of novel cognitive tests, biomarkers, and brain images collected every 6 months for as long as 6 years. The relative timing of the observations with respect to disease pathology is unknown. We propose a general semiparametric model and iterative estimation procedure to estimate simultaneously the pathological timing and long-term growth curves. The resulting estimates of long-term progression are fine-tuned using cognitive trajectories derived from the long-term "Personnes Ag??es Quid" study. Results We demonstrate with simulations that the method can recover long-term disease trends from short-term observations. The method also estimates temporal ordering of individuals with respect to disease pathology, providing subject-specific prognostic estimates of the time until onset of symptoms. When the method is applied to ADNI data, the estimated growth curves are in general agreement with prevailing theories of the Alzheimer's disease cascade. Other data sets with common outcome measures can be combined using the proposed algorithm.

In this work, effect of involving intermediate atrophy rates and impact of using uncorrelated principal components of these features instead of original ones on discriminating normal controls and Alzheimer's disease subjects, is inspected. In fact, linear discriminative analysis of atrophy rates is used to classify subjects into Alzheimer's disease and controls. Leave-one-out cross-validation has been adopted to evaluate the generalization rate of the classifier along with its memorization. Results show that incorporating uncorrelated version of intermediate features leads to the same memorization performance as the original ones but higher generalization rate. As a conclusion, it is revealed that in a longitudinal study, using intermediate MRI scans and transferring them to an uncorrelated feature space can improve diagnostic accuracy.},

However, they all perform poorly at separating stable MCI (MCI patients not converting to AD) and progressive MCI. Instead of using features extracted from a single temporal point, we address this problem using descriptors of the hippocampus evolutions between two time points. To encode the transformation, we use the framework of large deformations by diffeomorphisms that provides geodesic evolutions. To perform statistics on those local features in a common coordinate system, we introduce an extension of the K{\"{a}}rcher mean algorithm that defines the template modulo rigid registrations, and an initialization criterion that provides a final template leading to better matching with the patients. Finally, as local descriptors transported to this template do not directly perform as well as global descriptors (e.g. volume difference), we propose a novel strategy combining the use of initial momentum from geodesic shooting, extended K{\"{a}}rcher algorithm, density transport and integration on a hippocampus subregion, which is able to outperform global descriptors. {\textcopyright}2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In the context of Alzheimer's disease, two challenging issues are (1) the characterization of local hippocampal shape changes specific to disease progression and (2) the identification of mild-cognitive impairment patients likely to convert. In the literature, (1) is usually solved first to detect areas potentially related to the disease. These areas are then considered as an input to solve (2). As an alternative to this sequential strategy, we investigate the use of a classification model using logistic regression to address both issues (1) and (2) simultaneously. The classification of the patients therefore does not require any a priori definition of the most representative hippocampal areas potentially related to the disease, as they are automatically detected. We first quantify deformations of patients' hippocampi between two time points using the large deformations by diffeomorphisms framework and transport these deformations to a common template. Since the deformations are expected to be spatially structured, we perform classification combining logistic loss and spatial regularization techniques, which have not been explored so far in this context, as far as we know. The main contribution of this paper is the comparison of regularization techniques enforcing the coefficient maps to be spatially smooth (Sobolev), piecewise constant (total variation) or sparse (fused LASSO) with standard regularization techniques which do not take into account the spatial structure (LASSO, ridge and ElasticNet). On a dataset of 103 patients out of ADNI, the techniques using spatial regularizations lead to the best classification rates. They also find coherent areas related to the disease progression.},

abstract = {Dementia is characterised by its progressive degeneration of cognitive abilities. In research cohorts, detailed neuropsychological test batteries are often administered to better understand how cognition changes over time. Understanding cognitive changes in dementia is of great importance, particularly in determining how structural changes in the brain may affect cognition and in facilitating earlier detection of symptomatic changes. Disease progression models are often applied to these data to understand how a disease changes over time from cross-sectional data or to disease trajectories from large numbers of individuals. Previous disease progression models used to build longitudinal models from cross-sectional data have focused on brain imaging data; however, these models are not directly applicable to cognitive data. Here we use the novel, non-parametric, Kernel Density Estimation Mixture Modelling (KDEMM) approach and demonstrate accurate modelling of the progression of cognitive test data. We found that using KDEMM resulted in more accurate models of disease progression in simulated data compared to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for the majority of parameters used to simulate the data. When comparing KDEMM and GMM to cognitive data collected in different Alzheimer's Disease subtypes, we found the KDEMM resulted in a model much more in line with clinical phenotype. We anticipate that the KDEMM will be used to integrate cognitive test data, and other non-normally distributed datasets into complex disease progression models.},

abstract = {L ongitudinal data, comprising repeated measurements of the same individuals over time, arise frequently in cardiology and the biomedical sciences in general. For example, Frison and Pocock 1 used repeated measurements of the liver enzyme creatine kinase in serum of cardiac patients to study changes in liver function over a 12-month study period. The main goal, indeed the raison d'{\^{e}}tre, of a longi-tudinal study is characterization of changes in the response of interest over time. Ordinarily, changes in the response are also related to selected covariates. For example, Frison and Pocock 1 compared changes in creatine kinase between pa-tients randomized to active drug and placebo. The past 25 years have witnessed remarkable develop-ments in statistical methods for the analysis of longitudinal data. Despite these important advances, researchers in the biomedical sciences have been somewhat slow to adopt these methods and often rely on statistical techniques that fail to adequately account for longitudinal study designs. The goal of the present report is to provide an overview of some recently developed methods for longitudinal analyses that are more appropriate, with a focus on 2 methods for continuous responses: the analysis of response profiles and linear mixed-effects models. The analysis of response profiles is better suited to settings with a relatively small number of repeated measurements, obtained on a common set of occasions, whereas linear mixed-effects models are suitable in more general settings. Before describing these methods, we review some of the defining features of longitudinal studies and highlight the main aspects of longitudinal data that compli-cate their analysis. A common feature of repeated measurements on an individ-ual is correlation; that is, knowledge of the value of the response on one occasion provides information about the likely value of the response on a future occasion. Another common feature of longitudinal data is heterogeneous vari-ability; that is, the variance of the response changes over the duration of the study. These 2 features of longitudinal data violate the fundamental assumptions of independence and homogeneity of variance that are at the basis of many standard techniques (eg, t test, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression). To account for these features, statistical models for longitudinal data have 2 main components: a model for the covariance among repeated measures, coupled with a model for the mean response and its dependence on covari-ates (eg, treatment group in the context of clinical trials). By the term " covariance, " we mean both the correlations among pairs of repeated measures on an individual and the variabil-ity of the responses on different occasions (conversely, correlation can be interpreted as the standardized covariance). Although the main scientific interest is normally focused on the model for the mean response, inferences about change in the response and its relation to covariates are sensitive to the chosen model for the covariance among the repeated mea-sures. Failure to properly account for the covariance results in hypothesis tests and CIs that are invalid and may result in misleading inferences.},

abstract = {The early identification of brain anatomy deviating from the normal pattern of growth and atrophy, such as in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has the potential to improve clinical outcomes through early intervention. Recently, Davatzikos et al. (2009) supported the hypothesis that pathologic atrophy in AD is an accelerated aging process, implying accelerated brain atrophy. In order to recognize faster brain atrophy, a model of healthy brain aging is needed first. Here, we introduce a framework for automatically and efficiently estimating the age of healthy subjects from their T1-weighted MRI scans using a kernel method for regression. This method was tested on over 650 healthy subjects, aged 19-86??years, and collected from four different scanners. Furthermore, the influence of various parameters on estimation accuracy was analyzed. Our age estimation framework included automatic preprocessing of the T1-weighted images, dimension reduction via principal component analysis, training of a relevance vector machine (RVM; Tipping, 2000) for regression, and finally estimating the age of the subjects from the test samples. The framework proved to be a reliable, scanner-independent, and efficient method for age estimation in healthy subjects, yielding a correlation of r = 0.92 between the estimated and the real age in the test samples and a mean absolute error of 5??years. The results indicated favorable performance of the RVM and identified the number of training samples as the critical factor for prediction accuracy. Applying the framework to people with mild AD resulted in a mean brain age gap estimate (BrainAGE) score of + 10??years. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurofibrillary tangle and neuropil thread deposition, which ultimately results in neuronal loss. A large number of magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported a smaller hippocampus in AD patients as compared to healthy elderlies. Even though this difference is often interpreted as atrophy, it is only an indirect measurement. A more direct way of measuring the atrophy is to use repeated MRIs within the same individual. Even though several groups have used this appropriate approach, the pattern of hippocampal atrophy still remains unclear and difficult to relate to underlying pathophysiology. Here, in this longitudinal study, we aimed to map hippocampal atrophy rates in patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly controls. Data consisted of two MRI scans for each subject. The symmetric deformation field between the first and the second MRI was computed and mapped onto the three-dimensional hippocampal surface. The pattern of atrophy rate was similar in all three groups, but the rate was significantly higher in patients with AD than in control subjects. We also found higher atrophy rates in progressive MCI patients as compared to stable MCI, particularly in the antero-lateral portion of the right hippocampus. Importantly, the regions showing the highest atrophy rate correspond to those that were described to have the highest burden of tau deposition. Our results show that local hippocampal atrophy rate is a reliable biomarker of disease stage and progression and could also be considered as a method to objectively evaluate treatment effects.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, shares many aspects of abnormal brain aging. We present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based biomarker that predicts the individual progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD on the basis of pathological brain aging patterns. By employing kernel regression methods, the expression of normal brain-aging patterns forms the basis to estimate the brain age of a given new subject. If the estimated age is higher than the chronological age, a positive brain age gap estimation (BrainAGE) score indicates accelerated atrophy and is considered a risk factor for conversion to AD. Here, the BrainAGE framework was applied to predict the individual brain ages of 195 subjects with MCI at baseline, of which a total of 133 developed AD during 36 months of follow-up (corresponding to a pre-test probability of 68{\%}). The ability of the BrainAGE framework to correctly identify MCI-converters was compared with the performance of commonly used cognitive scales, hippocampus volume, and state-of-the-art biomarkers derived from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). With accuracy rates of up to 81{\%}, BrainAGE outperformed all cognitive scales and CSF biomarkers in predicting conversion of MCI to AD within 3 years of follow-up. Each additional year in the BrainAGE score was associated with a 10{\%} greater risk of developing AD (hazard rate: 1.10 [CI: 1.07-1.13]). Furthermore, the post-test probability was increased to 90{\%} when using baseline BrainAGE scores to predict conversion to AD. The presented framework allows an accurate prediction even with multicenter data. Its fast and fully automated nature facilitates the integration into the clinical workflow. It can be exploited as a tool for screening as well as for monitoring treatment options.},

abstract = {Incipient Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by a slow onset of clinical symptoms, with pathological brain changes starting several years earlier. Consequently, it is necessary to first understand and differentiate age-related changes in brain regions in the absence of disease, and then to support early and accurate AD diagnosis. However, there is poor understanding of the initial stage of AD; seemingly healthy elderly brains lose matter in regions related to AD, but similar changes can also be found in non-demented subjects having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). By using a Linear Mixed Effects approach, we modelled the change of 166 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based biomarkers available at a 5-year follow up on healthy elderly control (HC, n = 46) subjects. We hypothesized that, by identifying their significant variant (vr) and quasi-variant (qvr) brain regions over time, it would be possible to obtain an age-based null model, which would characterize their normal atrophy and growth patterns as well as the correlation between these two regions. By using the null model on those subjects who had been clinically diagnosed as HC (n = 161), MCI (n = 209) and AD (n = 331), normal age-related changes were estimated and deviation scores (residuals) from the observed MRI-based biomarkers were computed. Subject classification, as well as the early prediction of conversion to MCI and AD, were addressed through residual-based Support Vector Machines (SVM) modelling. We found reductions in most cortical volumes and thicknesses (with evident gender differences) as well as in sub-cortical regions, including greater atrophy in the hippocampus. The average accuracies (ACC) recorded for men and women were: AD-HC: 94.11{\%}, MCI-HC: 83.77{\%} and MCI converted to AD (cAD)-MCI non-converter (sMCI): 76.72{\%}. Likewise, as compared to standard clinical diagnosis methods, SVM classifiers predicted the conversion of cAD to be 1.9 years earlier for females (ACC:72.5{\%}) and 1.4 years earlier for males (ACC:69.0{\%}).},

In trying to organize and highlight the similarities and differences between them, we give a taxonomy of and review several multiple kernel learning algorithms. We perform experiments on real data sets for better illustration and comparison of existing algorithms. We see that though there may not be large differences in terms of accuracy, there is difference between them in complexity as given by the number of stored support vectors, the sparsity of the solution as given by the number of used kernels, and training time complexity. We see that overall, using multiple kernels instead of a single one is useful and believe that combining kernels in a nonlinear or data-dependent way seems more promising than linear combination in fusing information provided by simple linear kernels, whereas linear methods are more reasonable when combining complex Gaussian kernels.},

abstract = {Longitudinal patient data has the potential to improve clinical risk stratification models for disease. However, chronic diseases that progress slowly over time are often heterogeneous in their clinical presentation. Patients may progress through disease stages at varying rates. This leads to pathophysiological misalignment over time, making it difficult to consistently compare patients in a clinically meaningful way. Furthermore, patients present clinically for the first time at different stages of disease. This eliminates the possibility of simply aligning patients based on their initial presentation. Finally, patient data may be sampled at different rates due to differences in schedules or missed visits. To address these challenges, we propose a robust measure of patient similarity based on subsequence alignment. Compared to global alignment techniques that do not account for pathophysiological misalignment, focusing on the most relevant subsequences allows for an accurate measure of similarity between patients. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in settings where longitudinal data, while useful, are limited and lack a clear temporal alignment for comparison. Applied to the task of stratifying patients for risk of progression to probable Alzheimer's Disease, our approach outperforms models that use only snapshot data (AUROC of 0.839 vs. 0.812) and models that use global alignment techniques (AUROC of 0.822). Our results support the hypothesis that patients' trajectories are useful for quantifying inter-patient similarities and that using subsequence matching and can help account for heterogeneity and misalignment in longitudinal data.},

abstract = {Introduction Models characterizing intermediate disease stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed to inform clinical care and prognosis. Current models, however, use only a small subset of available biomarkers, capturing only coarse changes along the complete spectrum of disease progression. We propose the use of machine learning techniques and clinical, biochemical, and neuroimaging biomarkers to characterize progression to AD. Methods We used a large multimodal longitudinal data set of biomarkers and demographic and genotype information from 1624 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Using hidden Markov models, we characterized intermediate disease stages. We validated inferred disease trajectories by comparing time to first clinical AD diagnosis. We trained an L2-regularized logistic regression model to predict disease trajectory and evaluated its discriminative performance on a test set. Results We identified 12 distinct disease states. Progression to AD occurred most often through one of two possible paths through these states. Paths differed in terms of rate of disease progression (by 5.44 years on average), amyloid and total-tau (t-tau) burden (by 10{\%} and 69{\%}, respectively), and hippocampal neurodegeneration (P {\textless}.001). On the test set, the predictive model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85. Discussion Progression to AD, in terms of biomarker trajectories, can be predicted based on participant-specific factors. Such disease staging tools could help in targeting high-risk patients for therapeutic intervention trials. As longitudinal data with richer features are collected, such models will help increase our understanding of the factors that drive the different trajectories of AD.},

abstract = {Imaging biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease are desirable for improved diagnosis and monitoring, as well as drug discovery. Automated image-based classification of individual patients could provide valuable diagnostic support for clinicians, when considered alongside cognitive assessment scores. We investigate the value of combining cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-region FDG-PET information for classification, using clinical and imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Whole-brain segmentations into 83 anatomically defined regions were automatically generated for baseline and 12-month FDG-PET images. Regional signal intensities were extracted at each timepoint, as well as changes in signal intensity over the follow-up period. Features were provided to a support vector machine classifier. By combining 12-month signal intensities and changes over 12. months, we achieve significantly increased classification performance compared with using any of the three feature sets independently. Based on this combined feature set, we report classification accuracies of 88{\%} between patients with Alzheimer's disease and elderly healthy controls, and 65{\%} between patients with stable mild cognitive impairment and those who subsequently progressed to Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate that information extracted from serial FDG-PET through regional analysis can be used to achieve state-of-the-art classification of diagnostic groups in a realistic multi-centre setting. This finding may be usefully applied in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, predicting disease course in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and in the selection of participants for clinical trials. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Brain morphometry measures derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The objective of the present study was to test whether we could improve morphometry-based detection and prediction of disease state by use of white matter/gray matter (WM/GM) signal intensity contrast obtained from conventional MRI scans. We hypothesized that including WM/GM contrast change along with measures of atrophy in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampi would yield better classification of AD patients, and more accurate prediction of early disease progression. T1 -weighted MRI scans from two sessions approximately 2 years apart from 78 participants with AD (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0.5-2) and 71 age-matched controls were used to calculate annual change rates. Results showed that WM/GM contrast decay was larger in AD compared with controls in the medial temporal lobes. For the discrimination between AD and controls, entorhinal WM/GM contrast decay contributed significantly when included together with decrease in entorhinal cortical thickness and hippocampal volume, and increased the area under the curve to 0.79 compared with 0.75 when using the two morphometric variables only. Independent effects of WM/GM contrast decay and improved classification were also observed for the CDR-based subgroups, including participants converting from either a non-AD status to very mild AD, or from very mild to mild AD. Thus, WM/GM contrast decay increased diagnostic accuracy beyond what was obtained by well-validated morphometric measures alone. The findings suggest that signal intensity properties constitute a sensitive biomarker for cerebral degeneration in AD.},

abstract = {The assessment and prediction of a subject's current and future risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease are of great interest in both the design of clinical trials as well as in clinical decision making. Exploring the longitudinal trajectory of markers related to neurodegeneration is an important task when selecting subjects for treatment in trials and the clinic, in the evaluation of early disease indicators and the monitoring of disease progression. Given that there is substantial intersubject variability, models that attempt to describe marker trajectories for a whole population will likely lack specificity for the representation of individual patients. Therefore, we argue here that individualized models provide a more accurate alternative that can be used for tasks such as population stratification and a subject-specific prognosis. In the work presented here, mixed effects modeling is used to derive global and individual marker trajectories for a training population. Test subject (new patient) specific models are then instantiated using a stratified “marker signature” that defines a subpopulation of similar cases within the training database. From this subpopulation, personalized models of the expected trajectory of several markers are subsequently estimated for unseen patients. These patient specific models of markers are shown to provide better predictions of time-to-conversion to Alzheimer's disease than population based models.},

abstract = {The exploration of high-dimensional medical imaging datasets often requires the use of dimensionality reduction techniques. Generally, individual instances in longitudinal studies are not independent as several measurements of the same subjects, acquired at several time points, are included. Most non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, that rely on defining a neighborhood graph to uncover local geometry, neglect potentially valuable grouping information and thus can lead to a poor estimation of the underlying manifold. Incorporating a-priori grouping knowledge of the data can lead to an improved low-dimensional representation. In this work, an approach to leverage such a-priori information is proposed, with the main interest in generating longitudinal biomarkers to assess a subject's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and hence estimate time-to-conversion (TTC) and the mini mental state examination (MMSE) of subjects that develop AD. This is achieved via a novel formulation of the Laplacian Eigenmaps and Isomap manifold learning algorithms, that allows the incorporation of group-constraints. The potential of the proposed formulation was demonstrated on a swiss-roll toy example that clearly illustrates the problems faced by traditional techniques when additional structure is observed in the data. A real data experiment showed that the proposed constrained methods yielded improvements of ???16{\%} and ???6{\%} over the original unconstrained methods in kNN estimation of the TTC and MMSE on the ADNI database.},

While some new methods have been proposed to more accurately account for such data, these methods are based on iterative algorithms that are slow and failure-prone. In this article, we propose the use of the Sandwich Estimator method which first estimates the parameters of interest with a simple Ordinary Least Square model and second estimates variances/covariances with the "so-called" Sandwich Estimator (SwE) which accounts for the within-subject correlation existing in longitudinal data. Here, we introduce the SwE method in its classic form, and we review and propose several adjustments to improve its behaviour, specifically in small samples. We use intensive Monte Carlo simulations to compare all considered adjustments and isolate the best combination for neuroimaging data. We also compare the SwE method to other popular methods and demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we analyse a highly unbalanced longitudinal dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and demonstrate the flexibility of the SwE method to fit within- and between-subject effects in a single model.

abstract = {We propose a new method to maximize biomarker efficiency for detecting anatomical change over time in serial MRI. Drug trials using neuroimaging become prohibitively costly if vast numbers of subjects must be assessed, so it is vital to develop efficient measures of brain change. A popular measure of efficiency is the minimal sample size (n80) needed to detect 25{\%} change in a biomarker, with 95{\%} confidence and 80{\%} power. For multivariate measures of brain change, we can directly optimize n80 based on a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Here we use a supervised learning framework to optimize n80, offering two alternative solutions. With a new medial surface modeling method, we track 3D dynamic changes in the lateral ventricles in 2065 ADNI scans. We apply our LDA-based weighting to the results. Our best average n80-in two-fold nested cross-validation-is 104 MCI subjects (95{\%} CI: [94,139]) for a 1-year drug trial, and 75AD subjects [64,102]. This compares favorably with other MRI analysis methods. The standard "statistical ROI" approach applied to the same ventricular surfaces requires 165 MCI or 94AD subjects. At 2 years, the best LDA measure needs only 67 MCI and 52AD subjects, versus 119 MCI and 80AD subjects for the stat-ROI method. Our surface-based measures are unbiased: they give no artifactual additive atrophy over three time points. Our results suggest that statistical weighting may boost efficiency of drug trials that use brain maps.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the added value of hippocampal atrophy rates over whole brain volume measurements on MRI in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and controls. METHODS: We included 64 patients with AD (67 +/- 9 years; F/M 38/26), 44 patients with MCI (71 +/- 6 years; 21/23), and 34 controls (67 +/- 9 years; 16/18). Two MR scans were performed (scan interval: 1.8 +/- 0.7 years; 1.0 T), using a coronal three-dimensional T1-weighted gradient echo sequence. At follow-up, 3 controls and 23 patients with MCI had progressed to AD. Hippocampi were manually delineated at baseline. Hippocampal atrophy rates were calculated using regional, nonlinear fluid registration. Whole brain baseline volumes and atrophy rates were determined using automated segmentation and registration tools. RESULTS: All MRI measures differed between groups (p {\textless}0.005). For the distinction of MCI from controls, larger effect sizes of hippocampal measures were found compared to whole brain measures. Between MCI and AD, only whole brain atrophy rate differed significantly. Cox proportional hazards models (variables dichotomized by median) showed that within all patients without dementia, hippocampal baseline volume (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.7 [95{\%} confidence interval: 1.5-22.2]), hippocampal atrophy rate (5.2 [1.9-14.3]), and whole brain atrophy rate (2.8 [1.1-7.2]) independently predicted progression to AD; the combination of low hippocampal volume and high atrophy rate yielded a HR of 61.1 (6.1-606.8). Within patients with MCI, only hippocampal baseline volume and atrophy rate predicted progression. CONCLUSION: Hippocampal measures, especially hippocampal atrophy rate, best discriminate mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from controls. Whole brain atrophy rate discriminates Alzheimer disease (AD) from MCI. Regional measures of hippocampal atrophy are the strongest predictors of progression to AD.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have proposed biomarkers based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and predict the risk of evolution toward Alzheimer's disease (AD). While anatomical MRI captures structural alterations, studies demonstrated the ability of diffusion MRI to capture microstructural modifications at an earlier stage. Several methods have focused on hippocampus structure to detect AD. To date, the patch-based grading framework provides the best biomarker based on the hippocampus. However, this structure is complex since the hippocampus is divided into several heterogeneous subfields not equally impacted by AD. Former in-vivo imaging studies only investigated structural alterations of these subfields using volumetric measurements and microstructural modifications with mean diffusivity measurements. The aim of our work is to study the efficiency of hippocampal subfields compared to the whole hippocampus structure with a multimodal patch-based framework that enables to capture subtler structural and microstructural alterations. To this end, we analyze the significance of the different hippocampal subfields for AD diagnosis and prognosis with volumetric, diffusivity measurements and a novel multimodal patch-based grading framework that combines structural and diffusion MRI. The experiments conducted in this work showed that the whole hippocampus provides the most discriminant biomarkers for advanced AD detection while biomarkers applied into subiculum obtain the best results for AD prediction, improving by 2{\%} the accuracy compared to the whole hippocampus.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases affect over 20 million people worldwide, and this number is projected to significantly increase in the coming decades. Proposed imaging-based markers have shown steadily improving levels of sensitivity/specificity in classifying individual subjects as AD or normal. Several of these efforts have utilized statistical machine learning techniques, using brain images as input, as means of deriving such AD-related markers. A common characteristic of this line of research is a focus on either (1) using a single imaging modality for classification, or (2) incorporating several modalities, but reporting separate results for each. One strategy to improve on the success of these methods is to leverage all available imaging modalities together in a single automated learning framework. The rationale is that some subjects may show signs of pathology in one modality but not in another-by combining all available images a clearer view of the progression of disease pathology will emerge. Our method is based on the Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL) framework, which allows the inclusion of an arbitrary number of views of the data in a maximum margin, kernel learning framework. The principal innovation behind MKL is that it learns an optimal combination of kernel (similarity) matrices while simultaneously training a classifier. In classification experiments MKL outperformed an SVM trained on all available features by 3{\%}-4{\%}. We are especially interested in whether such markers are capable of identifying early signs of the disease. To address this question, we have examined whether our multi-modal disease marker (MMDM) can predict conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. Our experiments reveal that this measure shows significant group differences between MCI subjects who progressed to AD, and those who remained stable for 3. years. These differences were most significant in MMDMs based on imaging data. We also discuss the relationship between our MMDM and an individual's conversion from MCI to AD. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Cognitive scores at multiple time points can be reliably used to evaluate the progression of the disease clinically. In recent studies, machine learning techniques have shown promising results on the prediction of AD clinical scores. However, there are multiple limitations in the current models such as linearity assumption and missing data exclusion. Here, we present a nonlinear supervised sparse regression–based random forest (RF) framework to predict a variety of longitudinal AD clinical scores. Furthermore, we propose a soft-split technique to assign probabilistic paths to a test sample in RF for more accurate predictions. In order to benefit from the longitudinal scores in the study, unlike the previous studies that often removed the subjects with missing scores, we first estimate those missing scores with our proposed soft-split sparse regression–based RF and then utilize those estimated longitudinal scores at all the previous time points to predict the scores at the next time point. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method is superior to the traditional RF and outperforms other state-of-art regression models. Our method can also be extended to be a general regression framework to predict other disease scores.},

Risk factors (age, apolipoprotein $\epsilon$4 [APOE $\epsilon$4] genotype, gender, family history of AD, years of education) and baseline severity were tested as covariates. Results: Rate of disease progression increased with baseline severity. Age, APOE $\epsilon$4 genotype, and gender were identified as potential covariates influencing disease progression. The rate of disease progression in patients with mild to moderate AD was estimated as approximately 5.5 points/yr.

The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8{\%} for AD classification and 83.7{\%} for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0{\%} for AD classification and 84.2{\%} for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as—omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.},

This knowledge has been translated into new therapeutic strategies with putative disease-modifying effects. Several of the most promising approaches, such as amyloid-beta immunotherapy and secretase inhibition, are now being tested in clinical trials. Disease-modifying treatments might be at their most effective when initiated very early in the course of AD, before amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration become too widespread. Thus, biomarkers are needed that can detect AD in the predementia phase or, ideally, in presymptomatic individuals. In this Review, we present the rationales behind and the diagnostic performances of the core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD, namely total tau, phosphorylated tau and the 42 amino acid form of amyloid-beta. These biomarkers reflect AD pathology, and are candidate markers for predicting future cognitive decline in healthy individuals and the progression to dementia in patients who are cognitively impaired. We also discuss emerging plasma and CSF biomarkers, and explore new proteomics-based strategies for identifying additional CSF markers. Furthermore, we outline the roles of CSF biomarkers in drug discovery and clinical trials, and provide perspectives on AD biomarker discovery and the validation of such markers for use in the clinic.},

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) is a major cholesterol carrier that supports lipid transport and injury repair in the brain. APOE polymorphic alleles are the main genetic determinants of Alzheimer disease (AD) risk: individuals carrying the $\epsilon$4 allele are at increased risk of AD compared with those carrying the more common $\epsilon$3 allele, whereas the $\epsilon$2 allele decreases risk. Presence of the APOE $\epsilon$4 allele is also associated with increased risk of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and age-related cognitive decline during normal ageing. Apo-E-lipoproteins bind to several cell-surface receptors to deliver lipids, and also to hydrophobic amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide, which is thought to initiate toxic events that lead to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD. Apo-E isoforms differentially regulate A$\beta$ aggregation and clearance in the brain, and have distinct functions in regulating brain lipid transport, glucose metabolism, neuronal signalling, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial function. In this Review, we describe current knowledge on Apo-E in the CNS, with a particular emphasis on the clinical and pathological features associated with carriers of different Apo-E isoforms. We also discuss A$\beta$-dependent and A$\beta$-independent mechanisms that link Apo-E4 status with AD risk, and consider how to design effective strategies for AD therapy by targeting Apo-E.},

Methods: A stochastic, multistate model was used in conjunction with United Nations worldwide population forecasts and data from epidemiological studies of the risks of Alzheimer's disease. Results: In 2006, the worldwide prevalence of Alzheimer's disease was 26.6 million. By 2050, the prevalence will quadruple, by which time 1 in 85 persons worldwide will be living with the disease. We estimate about 43{\%} of prevalent cases need a high level of care, equivalent to that of a nursing home. If interventions could delay both disease onset and progression by a modest 1 year, there would be nearly 9.2 million fewer cases of the disease in 2050, with nearly the entire decline attributable to decreases in persons needing a high level of care. Conclusions: We face a looming global epidemic of Alzheimer's disease as the world's population ages. Modest advances in therapeutic and preventive strategies that lead to even small delays in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease can significantly reduce the global burden of this disease. {\textcopyright}2007 The Alzheimer's Association.},

In this study, we obtained magnetic resonance scans in 18 subjects with very mild DAT (CDR 0.5) and 26 age-matched nondemented controls (CDR 0) 2 years apart. Large-deformation high-dimensional brain mapping was used to quantify and compare changes in hippocampal shape as well as volume in the two groups of subjects. Hippocampal volume loss over time was significantly greater in the CDR 0.5 subjects (left = 8.3{\%}, right = 10.2{\%}) than in the CDR 0 subjects (left = 4.0{\%}, right = 5.5{\%}) (ANOVA, F = 7.81, P = 0.0078). We used singular-value decomposition and logistic regression models to quantify hippocampal shape change across time within individuals, and this shape change in the CDR 0.5 and CDR 0 subjects was found to be significantly different (Wilks's $\lambda$, P = 0.014). Further, at baseline, CDR 0.5 subjects, in comparison to CDR 0 subjects, showed inward deformation over 38{\%} of the hippocampal surface; after 2 years this difference grew to 47{\%}. Also, within the CDR 0 subjects, shape change between baseline and follow-up was largely confined to the head of the hippocampus and subiculum, while in the CDR 0.5 subjects, shape change involved the lateral body of the hippocampus as well as the head region and subiculum. These results suggest that different patterns of hippocampal shape change in time as well as different rates of hippocampal volume loss distinguish very mild DAT from healthy aging. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Similar to most chronic diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops slowly from a preclinical phase into a fully expressed clinical syndrome. We aimed to use longitudinal data to calculate the rates of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition, cerebral atrophy, and cognitive decline. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with AD were assessed at enrolment and every 18 months. At every visit, participants underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI, and a carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) PET scan. We included participants with three or more (11)C-PiB PET follow-up assessments. Abeta burden was expressed as (11)C-PiB standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) with the cerebellar cortex as reference region. An SUVR of 1.5 was used to discriminate high from low Abeta burdens. The slope of the regression plots over 3-5 years was used to estimate rates of change for Abeta deposition, MRI volumetrics, and cognition. We included those participants with a positive rate of Abeta deposition to calculate the trajectory of each variable over time. FINDINGS: 200 participants (145 healthy controls, 36 participants with MCI, and 19 participants with AD) were assessed at enrolment and every 18 months for a mean follow-up of 3.8 (95{\%} CI CI 3.6-3.9) years. At baseline, significantly higher Abeta burdens were noted in patients with AD (2.27, SD 0.43) and those with MCI (1.94, 0.64) than in healthy controls (1.38, 0.39). At follow-up, 163 (82{\%}) of the 200 participants showed positive rates of Abeta accumulation. Abeta deposition was estimated to take 19.2 (95{\%} CI 16.8-22.5) years in an almost linear fashion-with a mean increase of 0.043 (95{\%} CI 0.037-0.049) SUVR per year-to go from the threshold of (11)C-PiB positivity (1.5 SUVR) to the levels observed in AD. It was estimated to take 12.0 (95{\%} CI 10.1-14.9) years from the levels observed in healthy controls with low Abeta deposition (1.2 [SD 0.1] SUVR) to the threshold of (11)C-PiB positivity. As AD progressed, the rate of Abeta deposition slowed towards a plateau. Our projections suggest a prolonged preclinical phase of AD in which Abeta deposition reaches our threshold of positivity at 17.0 (95{\%} CI 14.9-19.9) years, hippocampal atrophy at 4.2 (3.6-5.1) years, and memory impairment at 3.3 (2.5-4.5) years before the onset of dementia (clinical dementia rating score 1). INTERPRETATION: Abeta deposition is slow and protracted, likely to extend for more than two decades.

abstract = {The number of service visits of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is different from each other and their visit time intervals are non-uniform. Although the literature has revealed many approaches in disease progression modeling, they fail to leverage these time-relevant part of patients' medical records in predicting disease's future status. This paper investigates how to predict the AD progression for a patient's next medical visit through leveraging heterogeneous medical data. Data provided by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center includes 5432 patients with probable AD from August 31, 2005 to May 25, 2017. Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (RNN) are adopted. The approach relies on an enhanced “many-to-one” RNN architecture to support the shift of time steps. Hence, the approach can deal with patients' various numbers of visits and uneven time intervals. The results show that the proposed approach can be utilized to predict patients' AD progressions on their next visits with over 99{\%} accuracy, significantly outperforming classic baseline methods. This study confirms that RNN can effectively solve the AD progression prediction problem by fully leveraging the inherent temporal and medical patterns derived from patients' historical visits. More promisingly, the approach can be customarily applied to other chronic disease progression problems.},

Collectively these may be regarded as m configurations, or scalings, each of n points in p-dimensions. The problem is investigated of translating, rotating, reflecting and scaling the m configurations to minimize the goodness-of-fit criterion $\Sigma$i=1m $\Sigma$i=1n $\Delta$2(Pj(i)Gi), where Gi is the centroid of the m points Pi(i) (i = 1, 2, ..., m). The rotated positions of each configuration may be regarded as individual analyses with the centroid configuration representing a consensus, and this relationship with individual scaling analysis is discussed. A computational technique is given, the results of which can be summarized in analysis of variance form. The special case m = 2 corresponds to Classical Procrustes analysis but the choice of criterion that fits each configuration to the common centroid configuration avoids difficulties that arise when one set is fitted to the other, regarded as fixed. {\textcopyright} 1975 Psychometric Society.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for the statistical analysis of the associations between longitudinal neuroimaging measurements, e.g., of cortical thickness, and the timing of a clinical event of interest, e.g., disease onset. The proposed approach consists of two steps, the first of which employs a linear mixed effects (LME) model to capture temporal variation in serial imaging data. The second step utilizes the extended Cox regression model to examine the relationship between time-dependent imaging measurements and the timing of the event of interest. We demonstrate the proposed method both for the univariate analysis of image-derived biomarkers, e.g., the volume of a structure of interest, and the exploratory mass-univariate analysis of measurements contained in maps, such as cortical thickness and gray matter density. The mass-univariate method employs a recently developed spatial extension of the LME model. We applied our method to analyze structural measurements computed using FreeSurfer, a widely used brain Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) analysis software package. We provide a quantitative and objective empirical evaluation of the statistical performance of the proposed method on longitudinal data from subjects suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) at baseline.},

abstract = {Multifactorial mechanisms underlying late-onset Alzheimer/'s disease (LOAD) are poorly characterized from an integrative perspective. Here spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-[beta] deposition, metabolism, vascular, functional activity at rest, structural properties, cognitive integrity and peripheral proteins levels are characterized in relation to LOAD progression. We analyse over 7,700 brain images and tens of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers from the Alzheimer/'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Through a multifactorial data-driven analysis, we obtain dynamic LOAD-abnormality indices for all biomarkers, and a tentative temporal ordering of disease progression. Imaging results suggest that intra-brain vascular dysregulation is an early pathological event during disease development. Cognitive decline is noticeable from initial LOAD stages, suggesting early memory deficit associated with the primary disease factors. High abnormality levels are also observed for specific proteins associated with the vascular system/'s integrity. Although still subjected to the sensitivity of the algorithms and biomarkers employed, our results might contribute to the development of preventive therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {Purpose Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) may be associated with total occlusion of the culprit artery, which is frequently not diagnosed on the standard 12-lead ECG. This may lead to missed opportunities for prompt reperfusion therapy. We sought to determine the prevalence of acute artery occlusion and location of culprit lesions involved in NSTEMI. Methods We examined 2219 consecutive patients with NSTEMI enrolled in a multicentre registry of acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The inclusion criteria were definite myocardial infarction (elevated troponin and/or CKMB with either symptoms and/or ST-segment depression) and invasive strategy within 72 hours of symptom onset. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the initial TIMI flow (TIMI 0/I, "occluded"; vs TIMI II/ III, "patent"). Baseline characteristics, treatment, culprit artery distribution and in-hospital outcome were compared. Results The prevalence of total occlusion was 33.9{\%} in the entire cohort. In patients with total occlusion, the culprit lesion was more frequently located in the arteries supplying the infero-lateral territory (circumflex, CX; right coronary artery, RCA) compared to patients with patent arteries (CX: 31.2{\%} vs 18.8{\%}, p {\textless} 0.01; RCA: 31.2{\%} vs 22.6{\%}, p {\textless} 0.01; LAD: 26.6{\%} vs 38.2{\%}, p {\textless} 0.01). Patients with total occlusion had significantly shorter delays to PCI (pain to PCI: 951 [460-1730] min. vs 1302 [582-2221] min., p {\textless} 0.01; door to PCI: 360 [125-1138] min. vs 180 [791-1483] min., p {\textless} 0.01). Inhospital mortality, however, was similar in both groups (TIMI I vs TIMI II/III 2.7 vs 1.8; p = n. s.). Conclusion Totally occluded culprit lesions occur in one third of patients with NSTEMI in a real world setting and are more frequently located in CX and RCA, but may also be seen in LAD territories. Early risk stratification needs to be enhanced to improve identification of "Pseudo-NSTEMIs" that would benefit from urgent reperfusion as in STEMI.},

Because of bias in images and in the algorithm itself, however, a penalty term and inverse consistency are needed to control the over-reporting of nonbiological change. These may force a tradeoff between the intrinsic sensitivity and specificity, potentially leading to an under-reporting of authentic biological change with time. We propose a new method incorporating prior information about tissue boundaries (where biological change is likely to exist) that aims to keep the robustness and specificity contributed by the penalty term and inverse consistency while maintaining localization and sensitivity. Results indicate that this method has improved sensitivity without increased noise.

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients are at a high risk of turning into Alzheimer's disease (AD) within years. But it is known that not all MCI patients will progress to AD. Therefore, it is of great interest to accurately diagnose whether a MCI patient will convert to AD (namely MCI converter; MCI-C) or not (namely MCI non-converter; MCI-NC), for early diagnosis and proper treatment. In this paper, we propose a multi-task sparse representation classifier to discriminate between MCI-C and MCI-NC utilizing longitudinal neuroimaging data. Unlike the previous methods that explicitly combined the longitudinal information in a feature domain, thus requiring the same number of measurements in time, the proposed method is not limited to the availability of the data. Specifically, by means of multi-task learning, we impose a group constraint that the same training samples, ideally belonging to the same class, are used to represent the longitudinal feature vectors across time points. Then we utilize a sparse representation classifier for label decision. From a machine learning perspective, the proposed method can be considered as the combination of the generative and discriminative methods, which are known to be effective in classification enhancement. In our experiments on magnetic resonance brain images of 349 MCI subjects (164 MCI-C and 185 MCI-NC) from ADNI database, we demonstrate the validity of the proposed method, which also outperforms the competing methods. {\textcopyright}2013 Springer International Publishing.},

This long "preclinical" phase of AD would provide a critical opportunity for therapeutic intervention; however, we need to further elucidate the link between the pathological cascade of AD and the emergence of clinical symptoms. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened an international workgroup to review the biomarker, epidemiological, and neuropsychological evidence, and to develop recommendations to determine the factors which best predict the risk of progression from "normal" cognition to mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. We propose a conceptual framework and operational research criteria, based on the prevailing scientific evidence to date, to test and refine these models with longitudinal clinical research studies. These recommendations are solely intended for research purposes and do not have any clinical implications at this time. It is hoped that these recommendations will provide a common rubric to advance the study of preclinical AD, and ultimately, aid the field in moving toward earlier intervention at a stage of AD when some disease-modifying therapies may be most efficacious. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Alzheimer's Association.

Characterising the time course of a disease with a protracted incubation period ultimately requires dense longitudinal studies, which can be prohibitively long and expensive. Considering what can be learned in the absence of such data, we estimate cohort-level biomarker trajectories by fitting cross-sectional data to a differential equation model, then integrating the fit. These fits inform our new stochastic differential equation model for synthesising individual-level biomarker trajectories for prognosis support. Our Bayesian multilevel regression model explicitly includes measurement noise estimation to avoid regression dilution bias. Applicable to any disease, here we perform experiments on Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarker data — volumes of regions of interest within the brain. We find that Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarkers are dynamic over timescales from a few years to a few decades.},

abstract = {Sparse learning has recently received increasing attentions in neuroimaging research such as brain disease diagnosis and progression. Most existing studies focus on cross-sectional analysis, i.e., learning a sparse model based on single time-point of data. However, in some brain imaging applications, multiple time-points of data are often available, thus longitudinal analysis can be performed to better uncover the underlying disease progression patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method aiming for longitudinal analysis with multiple time-points of data. Specifically, for each time-point, we train a sparse linear regression model by using the imaging data and the corresponding responses, and further use the group regularization to group the weights corresponding to the same brain region across different time-points together. Moreover, to reflect the smooth changes between adjacent time-points of data, we also include two smoothness regularization terms into the objective function, i.e., one fused smoothness term which requires the differences between two successive weight vectors from adjacent time-points should be small, and another output smoothness term which requires the differences between outputs of two successive models from adjacent time-points should also be small. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve the new objective function with both group-sparsity and smoothness regularizations. We validate our method through estimation of clinical cognitive scores using imaging data at multiple time-points which are available in the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database.},

abstract = {Mapping the effects of different clinical conditions on the evolution of the brain structural changes is of central interest in the field of neuroimaging. A reliable description of the cross-sectional longitudinal changes requires the consistent integration of intra and inter-subject variability in order to detect the subtle modifications in populations. In computational anatomy, the changes in the brain are often measured by deformation fields obtained through non rigid registration, and the stationary velocity field (SVF) parametrization provides a computationally efficient registration scheme. The aim of this study is to extend this framework into an efficient and robust multilevel one for accurately modeling the longitudinal changes in populations. This setting is used to investigate the subtle effects of the positivity of the CSF Abeta1-42 levels on brain atrophy in healthy aging. Thanks to the higher sensitivity of our framework, we obtain statistically significant results that highlight the relationship between brain damage and positivity to the marker of Alzheimer's disease and suggest the presence of a presymptomatic pattern of the disease progression.},

abstract = {We used a data-driven Bayesian model to automatically identify distinct latent factors of overlapping atrophy patterns from voxelwise structural MRIs of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia patients. Our approach estimated the extent to which multiple distinct atrophy patterns were expressed within each participant rather than assuming that each participant expressed a single atrophy factor. The model revealed a temporal atrophy factor (medial temporal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala), a subcortical atrophy factor (striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum), and a cortical atrophy factor (frontal, parietal, lateral temporal, and lateral occipital cortices). To explore the influence of each factor in early AD, atrophy factor compositions were inferred in beta-amyloid-positive (A$\beta$+) mild cognitively impaired (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) participants. All three factors were associated with memory decline across the entire clinical spectrum, whereas the cortical factor was associated with executive function decline in A$\beta$+ MCI participants and AD dementia patients. Direct comparison between factors revealed that the temporal factor showed the strongest association with memory, whereas the cortical factor showed the strongest association with executive function. The subcortical factor was associated with the slowest decline for both memory and executive function compared with temporal and cortical factors. These results suggest that distinct patterns of atrophy influence decline across different cognitive domains. Quantification of this heterogeneity may enable the computation of individual-level predictions relevant for disease monitoring and customized therapies. Factor compositions of participants and code used in this article are publicly available for future research.},

abstract = {Hippocampal atrophy, as evidenced using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is one of the most validated, easily accessible and widely used biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its imperfect sensitivity and specificity have highlighted the need to improve the analysis of MRI data. Based on neuropathological data showing a differential vulnerability of hippocampal subfields to AD processes, neuroimaging researchers have tried to capture corresponding morphological changes within the hippocampus. The present review provides an overview of the methodological developments that allow the assessment of hippocampal subfield morphology in vivo, and summarizes the results of studies looking at the effects of AD and normal aging on these structures. Most studies highlighted a focal atrophy of the CA1 subfield in the early (predementia or even preclinical) stages of AD, before atrophy becomes more widespread at the dementia stage, consistent with the pathological literature. Preliminary studies have indicated that looking at this focal atrophy pattern rather than standard whole hippocampus volumetry improves diagnostic accuracy at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. However, controversies remain regarding changes in hippocampal subfield structure in normal aging and regarding correlations between specific subfield volume and memory abilities, very likely because of the strong methodological variability between studies. Overall, hippocampal subfield analysis has proven to be a promising technique in the study of AD. However, harmonization of segmentation protocols and studies on larger samples are needed to enable accurate comparisons between studies and to confirm the clinical utility of these techniques.},

Regression analysis has been studied to relate neuroimagingmeasures to cognitive status. However, whether these measures have further predictive power to infer a trajectory of cognitive performance over time is still an under-explored but important topic in AD research. We propose a novel high-order multi-task learning model to address this issue. The proposed model explores the temporal correlations existing in imaging and cognitive data by structured sparsity-inducing norms. The sparsity of the model enables the selection of a small number of imaging measures while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

abstract = {The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays a significant role in patient care, especially at the early stage, because the consciousness of the severity and the progression risks allows the patients to take prevention measures before irreversible brain damages are shaped. Although many studies have applied machine learning methods for computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of AD recently, a bottleneck of the diagnosis performance was shown in most of the existing researches, mainly due to the congenital limitations of the chosen learning models. In this study, we design a deep learning architecture, which contains stacked auto-encoders and a softmax output layer, to overcome the bottleneck and aid the diagnosis of AD and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Compared to the previous workflows, our method is capable of analyzing multiple classes in one setting, and requires less labeled training samples and minimal domain prior knowledge. A significant performance gain on classification of all diagnosis groups was achieved in our experiments.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of neurodegenerative disorder with progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions. Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) is widely used as an important imaging modality for AD diagnosis. Most of existing methods for MRI classification are based on image data of single time point. However, the longitudinal analysis of sequential MR images is also important to model and measure the progression of the disease along the time axis. In this paper, we present a classification framework based on combination of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for longitudinal analysis of MR images for AD diagnosis. First, MLP is constructed to learn the spatial features of MR images with the task of AD classification. After that, RNN with cascaded two bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRU) layers is trained on the MLP outputs for extracting the longitudinal features from the imaging data of multiple time points, providing a final classification predicting score. The proposed method can automatically learn the spatial and longitudinal features from the imaging data of multiple time points with variable length for classification. Our method is evaluated using T1-weighted structural MR images on 428 subjects including 198 AD patients and 229 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 89.7{\%} for AD classification, demonstrating the promising classification performance.},

abstract = {Because of their increased sensitivity to spatially extended signals, cluster-size tests are widely used to detect changes and activations in brain images. However, when images are nonstationary, the cluster-size distribution varies depending on local smoothness. Clusters tend to be large in smooth regions, resulting in increased false positives, while in rough regions, clusters tend to be small, resulting in decreased sensitivity. Worsley et al. proposed a random field theory (RFT) method that adjusts cluster sizes according to local roughness of images [Worsley, K.J., 2002. Nonstationary FWHM and its effect on statistical inference of fMRI data. Presented at the 8th International Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain, June 2-6, 2002, Sendai, Japan. Available on CD-ROM in NeuroImage 16 (2) 779-780; Hum. Brain Mapp. 8 (1999) 98]. In this paper, we implement this method in a permutation test framework, which requires very few assumptions, is known to be exact [J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 16 (1996) 7] and is robust [NeuroImage 20 (2003) 2343]. We compared our method to stationary permutation, stationary RFT, and nonstationary RFT methods. Using simulated data, we found that our permutation test performs well under any setting examined, whereas the nonstationary RFT test performs well only for smooth images under high df. We also found that the stationary RFT test becomes anticonservative under nonstationarity, while both nonstationary RFT and permutation tests remain valid under nonstationarity. On a real PET data set we found that, though the nonstationary tests have reduced sensitivity due to smoothness estimation variability, these tests have better sensitivity for clusters in rough regions compared to stationary cluster-size tests. We include a detailed and consolidated description of Worsley nonstationary RFT cluster-size test. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with an irreversible and progressive process. Close monitoring of AD is essential for making adjustments in the treatment plan. Since clinical scores can indicate the disease status effectively, the prediction of the scores based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI data is highly desirable. Different from previous studies at a single time point, we propose to build a model to explore the relationship between MRI data and scores, thereby predicting longitudinal scores at future time points from the corresponding MRI data. The model incorporates three parts, correntropy regularized joint learning-based feature selection, deep polynomial network based feature encoding, and finally, support vector regression. The regression process is carried out for two scenarios. One is to use baseline data for predictions at future time points, and the other is to combine all the previous data for the prediction at the next time point. Meanwhile, the missing scores are filled in the second scenario to address the incompleteness presented in the data. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model accurately describes the relationship between MRI data and scores, and thus it can be effective in predicting longitudinal scores.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature Hippocampal atrophy measures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are powerful tools for monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. In this paper, we introduce a longitudinal image analysis framework based on robust registration and simultaneous hippocampal segmentation and longitudinal marker classification of brain MRI of an arbitrary number of time points. The framework comprises two innovative parts: a longitudinal segmentation and a longitudinal classification step. The results show that both steps of the longitudinal pipeline improved the reliability and the accuracy of the discrimination between clinical groups. We introduce a novel approach to the joint segmentation of the hippocampus across multiple time points; this approach is based on graph cuts of longitudinal MRI scans with constraints on hippocampal atrophy and supported by atlases. Furthermore, we use linear mixed effect (LME) modeling for differential diagnosis between clinical groups. The classifiers are trained from the average residue between the longitudinal marker of the subjects and the LME model. In our experiments, we analyzed MRI-derived longitudinal hippocampal markers from two publicly available datasets (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI and Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease, MIRIAD). In test/retest reliability experiments, the proposed method yielded lower volume errors and significantly higher dice overlaps than the cross-sectional approach (volume errors: 1.55{\%} vs 0.8{\%}; dice overlaps: 0.945 vs 0.975). To diagnose AD, the discrimination ability of our proposal gave an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) (Formula presented.) 0.947 for the control vs AD, AUC (Formula presented.) 0.720 for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs AD, and AUC (Formula presented.) 0.805 for the control vs MCI.},

abstract = {Current models of progression in neurodegenerative diseases use neuroimaging measures that are averaged across pre-defined regions of interest (ROIs). Such models are unable to recover fine details of atrophy patterns; they tend to impose an assumption of strong spatial correlation within each ROI and no correlation among ROIs. Such assumptions may be violated by the influence of underlying brain network connectivity on pathology propagation – a strong hypothesis e.g. in Alzheimer's Disease. Here we present DIVE: Data-driven Inference of Vertexwise Evolution. DIVE is an image-based disease progression model with single-vertex resolution, designed to reconstruct long-term patterns of brain pathology from short-term longitudinal data sets. DIVE clusters vertex-wise (i.e. point-wise) biomarker measurements on the cortical surface that have similar temporal dynamics across a patient population, and concurrently estimates an average trajectory of vertex measurements in each cluster. DIVE uniquely outputs a parcellation of the cortex into areas with common progression patterns, leading to a new signature for individual diseases. DIVE further estimates the disease stage and progression speed for every visit of every subject, potentially enhancing stratification for clinical trials or management. On simulated data, DIVE can recover ground truth clusters and their underlying trajectory, provided the average trajectories are sufficiently different between clusters. We demonstrate DIVE on data from two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), UK. The DRC cohort contains patients with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) as well as typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD). DIVE finds similar spatial patterns of atrophy for tAD subjects in the two independent datasets (ADNI and DRC), and further reveals distinct patterns of pathology in different diseases (tAD vs PCA) and for distinct types of biomarker data – cortical thickness from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs amyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). We demonstrate that DIVE stages have potential clinical relevance, despite being based only on imaging data, by showing that the stages correlate with cognitive test scores. Finally, DIVE can be used to estimate a fine-grained spatial distribution of pathology in the brain using any kind of voxelwise or vertexwise measures including Jacobian compression maps, fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or other PET measures.},

abstract = {The event-based model constructs a discrete picture of disease progression from cross-sectional data sets, with each event corresponding to a new biomarker becoming abnormal. However, it relies on the assumption that all subjects follow a single event sequence. This is a major simplification for sporadic disease data sets, which are highly heterogeneous, include distinct subgroups, and contain significant proportions of outliers. In this work we relax this assumption by considering two extensions to the event-based model: a generalised Mallows model, which allows subjects to deviate from the main event sequence, and a Dirichlet process mixture of generalised Mallows models, which models clusters of subjects that follow different event sequences, each of which has a corresponding variance. We develop a Gibbs sampling technique to infer the parameters of the two models from multi-modal biomarker data sets. We apply our technique to data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to determine the sequence in which brain regions become abnormal in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, as well as the heterogeneity of that sequence in the cohort. We find that the generalised Mallows model estimates a larger variation in the event sequence across subjects than the original event-based model. Fitting a Dirichlet process model detects three subgroups of the population with different event sequences. The Gibbs sampler additionally provides an estimate of the uncertainty in each of the model parameters, for example an individual's latent disease stage and cluster assignment. The distributions and mixtures of sequences that this new family of models introduces offer better characterisation of disease progression of heterogeneous populations, new insight into disease mechanisms, and have the potential for enhanced disease stratification and differential diagnosis.},

abstract = {A central issue in cognitive neuroscience today concerns how distributed neural networks in the brain that are used in language learning and processing can be involved in non-linguistic cognitive sequence learning. This issue is informed by a wealth of functional neurophysiology studies of sentence comprehension, along with a number of recent studies that examined the brain processes involved in learning non-linguistic sequences, or artificial grammar learning (AGL). The current research attempts to reconcile these data with several current neurophysiologically based models of sentence processing, through the specification of a neural network model whose architecture is constrained by the known cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) neuroanatomy of the human language system. The challenge is to develop simulation models that take into account constraints both from neuranatomical connectivity, and from functional imaging data, and that can actually learn and perform the same kind of language and artificial syntax tasks. In our proposed model, structural cues encoded in a recurrent cortical network in BA47 activate a CSTC circuit to modulate the flow of lexical semantic information from BA45 to an integrated representation of meaning at the sentence level in BA44/6. During language acquisition, corticostriatal plasticity is employed to allow closed class structure to drive thematic role assignment. From the AGL perspective, repetitive internal structure in the AGL strings is encoded in BA47, and activates the CSTC circuit to predict the next element in the sequence.

abstract = {The hippocampus is involved at the onset of the neuropathological pathways leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at increased risk of AD. Hippocampal volume has been shown to predict which MCI subjects will convert to AD. Our aim in the present study was to produce a fully automated prognostic procedure, scalable to high throughput clinical and research applications, for the prediction of MCI conversion to AD using 3D hippocampal morphology. We used an automated analysis for the extraction and mapping of the hippocampus from structural magnetic resonance scans to extract 3D hippocampal shape morphology, and we then applied machine learning classification to predict conversion from MCI to AD. We investigated the accuracy of prediction in 103 MCI subjects (mean age 74.1. years) from the longitudinal AddNeuroMed study. Our model correctly predicted MCI conversion to dementia within a year at an accuracy of 80{\%} (sensitivity 77{\%}, specificity 80{\%}), a performance which is competitive with previous predictive models dependent on manual measurements. Categorization of MCI subjects based on hippocampal morphology revealed more rapid cognitive deterioration in MMSE scores (p{\textless}0.01) and CERAD verbal memory (p{\textless}0.01) in those subjects who were predicted to develop dementia relative to those predicted to remain stable. The pattern of atrophy associated with increased risk of conversion demonstrated initial degeneration in the anterior part of the cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampal subregion. We conclude that automated shape analysis generates sensitive measurements of early neurodegeneration which predates the onset of dementia and thus provides a prognostic biomarker for conversion of MCI to AD. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {While neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by steady degeneration over relatively long timelines, it is widely believed that the early stages are the most promising for therapeutic intervention, before irreversible neuronal loss occurs. Developing a therapeutic response requires a precise measure of disease progression. However, since the early stages are for the most part asymptomatic, obtaining accurate measures of disease progression is difficult. Longitudinal databases of hundreds of subjects observed during several years with tens of validated biomarkers are becoming available, allowing the use of computational methods. We propose a widely applicable statistical methodology for creating a disease progression score (DPS), using multiple biomarkers, for subjects with a neurodegenerative disease. The proposed methodology was evaluated for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the publicly available AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, yielding an Alzheimer's DPS or ADPS score for each subject and each time-point in the database. In addition, a common description of biomarker changes was produced allowing for an ordering of the biomarkers. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall was found to be the earliest biomarker to become abnormal. The group of biomarkers comprising the volume of the hippocampus and the protein concentration amyloid beta and Tau were next in the timeline, and these were followed by three cognitive biomarkers. The proposed methodology thus has potential to stage individuals according to their state of disease progression relative to a population and to deduce common behaviors of biomarkers in the disease itself. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Objective: We aimed to examine the association of apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$4 genotype with neuroimaging markers of Alzheimer's disease: hippocampal volume, brain amyloid deposition and cerebral metabolism. Methods: We performed a systematic review and metaanalysis of 14 cross-sectional studies identified in Pubmed from 1996 to 2014 (n=1628). The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) was used to estimate the association between APOE and hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition. Meta-analysis was performed using effect size signed differential mapping using coordinates extracted from clusters with statistically significant difference in cerebral metabolic rate for glucose between APOE $\epsilon$4+ and $\epsilon$4- groups. Results: APOE $\epsilon$4 carrier status was associated with atrophic hippocampal volume (pooled SMD: -0.47; 95{\%} CI -0.82 to -0.13; p=0.007) and increased cerebral amyloid positron emission tomography tracer ( pooled SMD: 0.62, 95{\%} CI 0.27 to 0.98, p=0.0006). APOE $\epsilon$4 was also associated with decreased cerebral metabolism, especially in right middle frontal gyrus. Conclusions: APOE $\epsilon$4 was associated with atrophic hippocampal volume in MRI markers, increased cerebral amyloid deposition and cerebral hypometabolism. Theses associations may indicate the potential role of the APOE gene in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Structural brain changes have been described in both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, less is known about whether structural changes are detectable earlier, in the asymptomatic phase. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and shape analyses of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, we investigated structural brain differences between groups of healthy subjects, stratified by subsequent diagnoses of MCI or AD during a 10-year follow-up. Images taken at baseline, at least 4 years before any cognitive symptoms, showed that subjects with future cognitive impairment (preclinical AD and MCI) had reduced brain volume in medial temporal lobes, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and orbitofrontal cortex, compared with matched subjects who remained cognitively healthy for 10 years (HC). For only those subjects later diagnosed as AD, significantly greater atrophy at baseline was detected in the right medial temporal lobe, which was also confirmed by shape analysis of the right hippocampus in these subjects. Our results demonstrate that structural brain changes occur years before clinical cognitive decline in AD and are localized to regions affected by AD neuropathology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proven to be an effective tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. While conventional MRI-based AD diagnosis typically uses images acquired at a single time point, a longitudinal study is more sensitive in detecting early pathological changes of AD, making it more favorable for accurate diagnosis. In general, there are two challenges faced in MRI-based diagnosis. First, extracting features from structural MR images requires time-consuming nonlinear registration and tissue segmentation, whereas the longitudinal study with involvement of more scans further exacerbates the computational costs. Moreover, the inconsistent longitudinal scans (i.e., different scanning time points and also the total number of scans) hinder extraction of unified feature representations in longitudinal studies. In this paper, we propose a landmark-based feature extraction method for AD diagnosis using longitudinal structural MR images, which does not require nonlinear registration or tissue segmentation in the application stage and is also robust to inconsistencies among longitudinal scans. Specifically, first, the discriminative landmarks are automatically discovered from the whole brain using training images, and then efficiently localized using a fast landmark detection method for testing images, without the involvement of any nonlinear registration and tissue segmentation; and second, high-level statistical spatial features and contextual longitudinal features are further extracted based on those detected landmarks, which can characterize spatial structural abnormalities and longitudinal landmark variations. Using these spatial and longitudinal features, a linear support vector machine is finally adopted to distinguish AD subjects or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects from healthy controls (HCs). Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed method, with classification accuracies of 88.30{\%} for AD versus HC and 79.02{\%} for MCI versus HC, respectively.},

We also identiﬁed a subgroup of control subjects with brain structure and cognitive changes highly similar to those observed in AD.

abstract = {BACKGROUND 100 years after the first description, Alzheimer's disease is one of the most disabling and burdensome health conditions worldwide. We used the Delphi consensus method to determine dementia prevalence for each world region. METHODS 12 international experts were provided with a systematic review of published studies on dementia and were asked to provide prevalence estimates for every WHO world region, for men and women combined, in 5-year age bands from 60 to 84 years, and for those aged 85 years and older. UN population estimates and projections were used to estimate numbers of people with dementia in 2001, 2020, and 2040. We estimated incidence rates from prevalence, remission, and mortality. FINDINGS Evidence from well-planned, representative epidemiological surveys is scarce in many regions. We estimate that 24.3 million people have dementia today, with 4.6 million new cases of dementia every year (one new case every 7 seconds). The number of people affected will double every 20 years to 81.1 million by 2040. Most people with dementia live in developing countries (60{\%} in 2001, rising to 71{\%} by 2040). Rates of increase are not uniform; numbers in developed countries are forecast to increase by 100{\%} between 2001 and 2040, but by more than 300{\%} in India, China, and their south Asian and western Pacific neighbours.

abstract = {Modelling longitudinal changes in organs is fundamental for the understanding of biological and pathological processes. Most of the previous works on spatio-temporal modelling of image time series relies on the assumption of stationarity of the local spatial correlation, and on the separability between spatial and temporal processes. These assumptions are often made in order to lead to computationally tractable approaches to longitudinal modelling, but inevitably lead to an oversimplification of the complex spatial and temporal dynamics underlying the biological processes. In this work we propose a novel spatio-temporal generative model of time series of images based on kernel convolutions of a white noise Gaussian process. The proposed model is parameterised by a sparse set of control points independently identified by specific spatial and temporal parameters. This formulation is highly flexible and can naturally account for spatially and temporally varying dynamics of changes. We demonstrate a preliminary application of our non-parametric method on the modelling of within-subject structural changes in the context of longitudinal analysis in Alzheimer's disease. In particular we show that our method provides an accurate description of the pathological evolution of the brain, while showing high flexibility in modelling and predicting region-specific non-linearity due to accelerated structural decline in dementia.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for the early diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of AD. Therefore, patients with MCI who are at high risk of fully developing AD should be identified to accurately predict AD. However, the relationship between brain images and AD is difficult to construct because of the complex characteristics of neuroimaging data. To address this problem, we present a longitudinal measurement of MCI brain images and a hierarchical classification method for AD prediction. Longitudinal images obtained from individuals with MCI were investigated to acquire important information on the longitudinal changes, which can be used to classify MCI subjects as either MCI conversion (MCIc) or MCI non-conversion (MCInc) individuals. Moreover, a hierarchical framework was introduced to the classifier to manage high feature dimensionality issues and incorporate spatial information for improving the prediction accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated using 131 patients with MCI (70 MCIc and 61 MCInc) based on MRI scans taken at different time points. Results showed that the proposed method achieved 79.4{\%} accuracy for the classification of MCIc versus MCInc, thereby demonstrating very promising performance for AD prediction.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to discriminate Alzheimer's disease patients from healthy control individuals using longitudinal neuroimaging data. Distinctions between Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and healthy subjects in a multi-modal heterogeneous longitudinal dataset is a challenging problem due to high similarity between brain patterns, high portions of missing data from different modalities and time points, and inconsistent number of test intervals between different subjects. Due to these challenges, to distinguish AD patients from healthy subjects, conventionally researchers use cross-sectional data when applying deep learning methods in neuroimaging applications. Whereas we propose a method based on RNNS to analyze the longitudinal data. After carefully preprocessing the data to alleviate the inconsistency due to different data sources and various protocols of capturing modalities, we arrange the data and feed it into variations of RNNs, i.e., vanilla Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The accuracy, F-score, sensitivity, and specificity of our models are reported and are compared with the most immediate baseline method, multi-layer perceptron (MLP).},

abstract = {We evaluated a new magnetic resonance (MR)-based technique for performing volumetric measurements of temporal lobe structures. The technique was designed to assist in making the clinical diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). We chose specific anatomic regions of interest because of their known involvement in memory function and in the neuropathology of DAT and used a regression model to assess the effects of age on the volumes of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and the hippocampal formation (HF). These measurements were normalized by total intracranial volume (TIV). The volumetric measurements of both the normalized ATL and HF were significantly smaller (p less than 0.001) in DAT patients (N = 20) than in controls (N = 22), but the HF volumes provided much better separation between the two groups. Eighty-five percent of the DAT patients fell below the range of the HF/TIV measurement for the control subjects. This separation held up over the entire age range studied. Normalized volumes of both the HF and ATL decreased with age significantly for both the DAT patients and the controls. These results support the contention that MR-based HF volumetric measurements are accurate in differentiating DAT patients from cognitively normal elderly individuals. This technique may be a useful adjunct in making the clinical diagnosis of DAT.},

These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood.

We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records.

How to recognize AD at early stage is crucial. Multiple models have been presented to predict cognitive impairments by means of neuroimaging data. However,traditional models did not employ the valuable longitudinal information along the progression of the disease. In this paper,we proposed a novel longitudinal feature learning model to simultaneously uncover the interrelations among different cognitive measures at different time points and utilize such interrelated structures to enhance the learning of associations between imaging features and prediction tasks. Moreover,we adopted Schatten p-norm to identify the interrelation structures existing in the low-rank subspace. Empirical results on the ADNI cohort demonstrated promising performance of our model.},

abstract = {We describe a new method to automatically discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly controls, based on multidimensional classification of hippocampal shape features. This approach uses spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients to model the shape of the hippocampi, which are segmented from magnetic resonance images (MRI) using a fully automatic method that we previously developed. SPHARM coefficients are used as features in a classification procedure based on support vector machines (SVM). The most relevant features for classification are selected using a bagging strategy. We evaluate the accuracy of our method in a group of 23 patients with AD (10 males, 13 females, age ± standard-deviation (SD) = 73 ± 6 years, mini-mental score (MMS) = 24.4 ± 2.8), 23 patients with amnestic MCI (10 males, 13 females, age ± SD = 74 ± 8 years, MMS = 27.3 ± 1.4) and 25 elderly healthy controls (13 males, 12 females, age ± SD = 64 ± 8 years), using leave-one-out cross-validation. For AD vs controls, we obtain a correct classification rate of 94{\%}, a sensitivity of 96{\%}, and a specificity of 92{\%}. For MCI vs controls, we obtain a classification rate of 83{\%}, a sensitivity of 83{\%}, and a specificity of 84{\%}. This accuracy is superior to that of hippocampal volumetry and is comparable to recently published SVM-based whole-brain classification methods, which relied on a different strategy. This new method may become a useful tool to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment is a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For effective treatment of AD, it is important to identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients who are at a high risk of developing AD over the course of time. In this study, autoregressive modelling of multiple heterogeneous predictors of Alzheimer's disease is performed to capture their evolution over time. The models are trained using three different arrangements of longitudinal data. These models are then used to estimate future biomarker readings of individual test subjects. Finally, standard support vector machine classifier is employed for detecting MCI patients at risk of developing AD over the coming years. The proposed models are thoroughly evaluated for their predictive capability using both cognitive scores and MRI-derived measures. In a stratified five-fold cross validation setup, our proposed methodology delivered highest AUC of 88.93{\%} (Accuracy = 84.29{\%}) and 88.13{\%} (Accuracy = 83.26{\%}) for 1 year and 2 year ahead AD conversion prediction, respectively, on the most widely used Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative data. The notable conclusions of this study are: 1) Clinical changes in MRI-derived measures can be better forecasted than cognitive scores, 2) Multiple predictor models deliver better conversion prediction than single biomarker models, 3) Cognitive score boosted by MRI-derived measures delivers better short-term ahead conversion prediction, and 4) Neuropsychological scores alone can deliver good accuracy for long-term conversion prediction.},

Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

abstract = {Repeated failures in clinical trials for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have raised a strong interest for the prodromal phase of the disease. A better understanding of the brain alterations during this early phase is crucial to diagnose patients sooner, to estimate an accurate disease stage and to give a reliable prognosis.

According to recent evidence, structural alterations in the brain are likely to be sensitive markers of the disease progression. Neuronal loss translates in specific spatiotemporal patterns of cortical atrophy, starting in the enthorinal cortex and spreading over other cortical regions according to specific propagation pathways.

We developed a digital model $\backslash$textcolor{\{}blue!90{\}}{\{}of the cortical atrophy in the left hemisphere from prodromal to diseased phases{\}}, which is built on the temporal alignment and combination of several short-term observation data to reconstruct the long-term history of the disease. The model not only provides a description of the spatiotemporal patterns of cortical atrophy at the group level, but also shows the variability of these patterns at the individual level in terms of difference in propagation pathways, speed of propagation and age at propagation onset.

Longitudinal MRI datasets of patients with mild cognitive impairments who converted to AD are used to reconstruct the cortical atrophy propagation across all disease stages. Each observation is considered as a signal spatially distributed on a network, such as the cortical mesh, each cortex location being associated to a node. We consider how the temporal profile of the signal varies across the network nodes.

We introduce a statistical mixed-effect model to describe the evolution of the cortex alterations. To ensure a spatiotemporal smooth propagation of the alterations, we introduce a constrain on the propagation signal in the model such that neighboring nodes have similar profiles of the signal changes. Our generative model enables the reconstruction of personalized patterns of the neurodegenerative spread, providing a way to estimate disease progression stages and predict the age at which the disease will be diagnosed. The model shows that, for instance, APOE carriers have a significantly higher pace of cortical atrophy but not earlier atrophy onset.},

abstract = {Background: The heterogeneity and complexity of Alzheimer disease (AD) lends itself to dynamic causal modeling, a computational systems biology approach to simulate complex systems. Methods: We implemented a computational dynamic causal model (DCM) to test the common descriptive assumptions of biomarker evolution in AD. We modeled beta-amyloid, tau, neuro-degeneration and cognitive impairment as first order non-linear differential equations to include beta-amyloid dependent and non-dependent neurodegenerative cascades. We tested the DCM, by adjusting its parameters to simulate three specific simulation scenarios in early-onset autosomal dominant AD and late-onset AD, to determine whether computed biomarker trajectories agreed with current assumptions of AD progression. We also simulated the effects of anti-amyloid therapy in late-onset AD. Results: The computational model of early-onset pure AD demonstrated the initial appearance of amyloid, followed by other biomarkers of tau and neurodegeneration, followed by the onset of cognitive decline as predicted by prior literature. The model also showed the ability to vary onset of cognitive decline based on cognitive reserve. Similarly, the late-onset AD computational models demonstrated the first appearance of amyloid-related or non-amyloid-related tauopathy, depending on the magnitude of age-related comorbid pathology, and also closely matched the cascade predicted by prior literature. Forward simulation of anti-amyloid therapy in symptomatic late-onset AD failed to demonstrate any benefit on cognitive decline, consistent with prior failed clinical trials in symptomatic patients. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first computational model of the dynamic biomarker cascade in autosomal dominant and late-onset AD. Such models, with refinement using actual molecular, clinical and genomic data, are an important tool towards developing a systems biology precision medicine approach for understanding and preventing AD.},

Specifically, the method presented here aims to model Gray matter (GM) variation at different brain areas of a subject across subsequent examinations, being possible to relate those regions which degenerate jointly. Hence, it allows determining variation patterns that differentiate controls from AD patients. Additionally, White matter (WM) density is also incorporated to the longitudinal model to complement the information provided by GM. The results obtained demonstrated the effectiveness of the method in the extraction of these patterns, that can be used to classify between Controls (CN) and AD subjects with 94{\%} of accuracy, outperforming other previous methods.},

In one of the largest brain mapping studies to date, we mapped the 3D profile of hippocampal degeneration over time in 490 subjects scanned twice with brain MRI over a 1-year interval (980 scans). We examined baseline and 1-year follow-up scans of 97 AD subjects (49 males/48 females), 148 healthy control subjects (75 males/73 females), and 245 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; 160 males/85 females). We used our previously validated automated segmentation method, based on AdaBoost, to create 3D hippocampal surface models in all 980 scans. Hippocampal volume loss rates increased with worsening diagnosis (normal = 0.66{\%}/year; MCI = 3.12{\%}/year; AD = 5.59{\%}/year), and correlated with both baseline and interval changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and global and sum-of-boxes Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) scores. Surface-based statistical maps visualized a selective profile of ongoing atrophy in all three diagnostic groups. Healthy controls carrying the ApoE4 gene atrophied faster than non-carriers, while more educated controls atrophied more slowly; converters from MCI to AD showed faster atrophy than non-converters. Hippocampal loss rates can be rapidly mapped, and they track cognitive decline closely enough to be used as surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease in drug trials. They also reveal genetically greater atrophy in cognitively intact subjects.},

abstract = {The estimation of disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on a vector of quantitative biomarkers is of high interest to clinicians, patients, and biomedical researchers alike. In this work, quantile regression is employed to learn statistical models describing the evolution of such biomarkers. Two separate models are constructed using (1) subjects that progress from a cognitively normal (CN) stage to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and (2) subjects that progress from MCI to AD during the observation window of a longitudinal study. These models are then automatically combined to develop a multi-stage disease progression model for the whole disease course. A probabilistic approach is derived to estimate the current disease progress (DP) and the disease progression rate (DPR) of a given individual by fitting any acquired biomarkers to these models. A particular strength of this method is that it is applicable even if individual biomarker measurements are missing for the subject. Employing cognitive scores and image-based biomarkers, the presented method is used to estimate DP and DPR for subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Further, the potential use of these values as features for different classification tasks is demonstrated. For example, accuracy of 64{\%} is reached for CN vs. MCI vs. AD classification.},

@article{Aksman2019,
abstract = {Longitudinal imaging biomarkers are invaluable for understanding the course of neurodegeneration, promising the ability to track disease progression and to detect disease earlier than cross-sectional biomarkers. To properly realize their potential, biomarker trajectory models must be robust to both under-sampling and measurement errors and should be able to integrate multi-modal information to improve trajectory inference and prediction. Here we present a parametric Bayesian multi-task learning based approach to modeling univariate trajectories across subjects that addresses these criteria. Our approach learns multiple subjects' trajectories within a single model that allows for different types of information sharing, i.e. coupling , across subjects. It optimizes a combination of uncoupled, fully coupled and kernel coupled models. Kernel-based coupling allows linking subjects' trajectories based on one or more biomarker measures. We demonstrate this using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, where we model longitudinal trajectories of MRI-derived cortical volumes in neurodegeneration, with coupling based on APOE genotype, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amyloid PET-based biomarkers. In addition to detecting established disease effects, we detect disease related changes within the insula that have not received much attention within the literature. Due to its sensitivity in detecting disease effects, its competitive predictive performance and its ability to learn the optimal parameter covariance from data rather than choosing a specific set of random and fixed effects a priori, we propose that our model can be used in place of or in addition to linear mixed effects models when modeling biomarker trajectories. A software implementation of the method is publicly available.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a predictive regression model for longitudinal images with missing data based on large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) and deep neural networks. Instead of directly predicting image scans, our model predicts a vector momentum sequence associated with a baseline image. This momentum sequence parameterizes the original image sequence in the LDDMM framework and lies in the tangent space of the baseline image, which is Euclidean. A recurrent network with long term-short memory (LSTM) units encodes the time-varying changes in the vector-momentum sequence, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) encodes the baseline image of the vector momenta. Features extracted by the LSTM and CNN are fed into a decoder network to reconstruct the vector momentum sequence, which is used for the image sequence prediction by deforming the baseline image with LDDMM shooting. To handle the missing images at some time points, we adopt a binary mask to ignore their reconstructions in the loss calculation. We evaluate our model on synthetically generated images and the brain MRIs from the OASIS dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the promising predictions of the spatiotemporal changes in both datasets, irrespective of large or subtle changes in longitudinal image sequences.},

Emerging knowledge on apoE-related pathways in the pathophysiology of AD presents new opportunities for AD therapy. We describe the biochemical and biological features of apoE and apoE receptors in the central nervous system. We also discuss the evidence and mechanisms addressing differential effects of apoE isoforms and the role of apoE receptors in AD pathogenesis, with a particular emphasis on the clinical and preclinical studies related to amyloid-$\beta$ pathology. Finally, we summarize the current strategies of AD therapy targeting apoE, and postulate that effective strategies require an apoE isoform-specific approach.},

abstract = {We developed an anatomical mapping technique to detect hippocampal and ventricular changes in Alzheimer disease (AD). The resulting maps are sensitive to longitudinal changes in brain structure as the disease progresses. An anatomical surface modeling approach was combined with surface-based statistics to visualize the region and rate of atrophy in serial MRI scans and isolate where these changes link with cognitive decline. Fifty-two high-resolution MRI scans were acquired from 12 AD patients (age: 68.4 ± 1.9 years) and 14 matched controls (age: 71.4 ± 0.9 years), each scanned twice (2.1 ± 0.4 years apart). 3D parametric mesh models of the hippocampus and temporal horns were created in sequential scans and averaged across subjects to identify systematic patterns of atrophy. As an index of radial atrophy, 3D distance fields were generated relating each anatomical surface point to a medial curve threading down the medial axis of each structure. Hippocampal atrophic rates and ventricular expansion were assessed statistically using surface-based permutation testing and were faster in AD than in controls. Using color-coded maps and video sequences, these changes were visualized as they progressed anatomically over time. Additional maps localized regions where atrophic changes linked with cognitive decline. Temporal horn expansion maps were more sensitive to AD progression than maps of hippocampal atrophy, but both maps correlated with clinical deterioration. These quantitative, dynamic visualizations of hippocampal atrophy and ventricular expansion rates in aging and AD may provide a promising measure to track AD progression in drug trials. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The term prediction implies expected outcome in the future, often based on a model and statistical inference. Longitudinal imaging studies offer the possibility to model temporal change trajectories of anatomy across populations of subjects. In the spirit of subject-specific analysis, such normative models can then be used to compare data from new subjects to the norm and to study progression of disease or to predict outcome. This paper follows a statistical inference approach and presents a framework for prediction of future observations based on past measurements and population statistics. We describe prediction in the context of nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NLME) where the full reference population's statistics (estimated fixed effects, variance-covariance of random effects, variance of noise) is used along with the individual's available observations to predict its trajectory. The proposed methodology is generic in regard to application domains. Here, we demonstrate analysis of early infant brain maturation from longitudinal DTI with up to three time points. Growth as observed in DTI-derived scalar invariants is modeled with a parametric function, its parameters being input to NLME population modeling. Trajectories of new subject's data are estimated when using no observation, only the first or the first two time points. Leave-one-out experiments result in statistics on differences between actual and predicted observations. We also simulate a clinical scenario of prediction on multiple categories, where trajectories predicted from multiple models are classified based on maximum likelihood criteria.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia is expanding rapidly, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes. A reappraisal of global prevalence and numbers is due, given the significant implications for social and public policy and planning. METHODS In this study we provide a systematic review of the global literature on the prevalence of dementia (1980-2009) and metaanalysis to estimate the prevalence and numbers of those affected, aged ≥60 years in 21 Global Burden of Disease regions. RESULTS Age-standardized prevalence for those aged ≥60 years varied in a narrow band, 5{\%}-7{\%} in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in Latin America (8.5{\%}), and a distinctively lower prevalence in the four sub-Saharan African regions (2{\%}-4{\%}). It was estimated that 35.6 million people lived with dementia worldwide in 2010, with numbers expected to almost double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. In 2010, 58{\%} of all people with dementia lived in countries with low or middle incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63{\%} in 2030 and 71{\%} in 2050. CONCLUSION The detailed estimates in this study constitute the best current basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources in dementia care. The age-specific prevalence of dementia varies little between world regions, and may converge further. Future projections of numbers of people with dementia may be modified substantially by preventive interventions (lowering incidence), improvements in treatment and care (prolonging survival), and disease-modifying interventions (preventing or slowing progression). All countries need to commission nationally representative surveys that are repeated regularly to monitor trends.},

The entropy-minimization model may also include image- and surface-based features, such as surface curvature information, in order to find better correspondence in complex and varied anatomy. PBM requires very little preprocessing or parameter tuning and has been applied to a wide variety of biomedical shape analysis problems, including neurobiology, genetic phenotyping, orthopedics, and cardiology. The ShapeWorks software includes extensions to the basic PBM optimization to construct joint models of multiple anatomical shapes, regression models, and to specify surface boundaries on shapes, such as cutting planes.

The disease progression is modeled as a trajectory on a group of diffeomorphisms in the context of large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM). We first exhibit the limited predictive abilities of geodesic regression extrapolation on this group. Building on the recent concept of parallel curves in shape manifolds, we then introduce a second predictive protocol which personalizes previously learned trajectories to new subjects, and investigate the relative performances of two parallel shifting paradigms.

Imaging modalities such as T1W (T1-Weighted) and T2W (T2-Weighted) MRI each display specific patterns of appear- ance change associated with distinct neurobiological components of these maturational processes. In this paper we present a framework to jointly model multimodal appearance changes across time for a longitudinal imaging dataset, resulting in quantitative assessment of the patterns of early brain maturation not yet available to clinicians. We measure appearance by quantifying contrast between white and gray matter in terms of the distance between their intensity distributions, a method demonstrated to be relatively stable to interscan variability. A multi- variate nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) model is used for joint statis- tical modeling of this contrast measure across multiple imaging modal- ities. The multivariate NLME procedure considers correlations between modalities in addition to intra-modal variability. The parameters of the logistic growth function used in NLME modeling provide useful quanti- tative information about the timing and progression of contrast change in multimodal datasets. Inverted patterns of relative white-gray matter intensity gradient that are observable in T1W scans with respect to T2W scans are characterized by the SIR (Signal Intensity Ratio). The CON- TDIR (Contrast Direction) which measures the direction of the gradient at each time point relative to that in the adult-like scan adds a direc- tional attribute to contrast. The major contribution of this paper is a framework for joint multimodal temporal modeling of white-gray matter MRI contrast change and estimation of subject-specific and population This growth trajectories. Results confirm qualitative descriptions of growth patterns in pediatric radiology studies and our new quantitative mod- eling scheme has the potential to advance understanding of variability of brain tissue maturation and to eventually differentiate normal from abnormal growth for early diagnosis of pathology.},

abstract = {The early detection and classification of dementia are important clinical support tasks for medical practitioners in customizing patient treatment programs to better manage the development and progression of these diseases. Efforts are being made to diagnose these neurodegenerative disorders in the early stages. Indeed, early diagnosis helps patients to obtain the maximum treatment benefit before significant mental decline occurs. The use of electroencephalogram as a tool for the detection of changes in brain activities and clinical diagnosis is becoming increasingly popular for its capabilities in quantifying changes in brain degeneration in dementia. This paper reviews the role of electroencephalogram as a biomarker based on signal processing to detect dementia in early stages and classify its severity. The review starts with a discussion of dementia types and cognitive spectrum followed by the presentation of the effective preprocessing denoising to eliminate possible artifacts. It continues with a description of feature extraction by using linear and nonlinear techniques, and it ends with a brief explanation of vast variety of separation techniques to classify EEG signals. This paper also provides an idea from the most popular studies that may help in diagnosing dementia in early stages and classifying through electroencephalogram signal processing and analysis.},

abstract = {Disease progression modeling (DPM) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) aims at revealing long term pathological trajectories from short term clinical data. Along with the ability of providing a data-driven description of the natural evolution of the pathology, DPM has the potential of representing a valuable clinical instrument for automatic diagnosis, by explicitly describing the biomarker transition from normal to pathological stages along the disease time axis. In this work we reformulated DPM within a probabilistic setting to quantify the diagnostic uncertainty of individual disease severity in an hypothetical clinical scenario, with respect to missing measurements, biomarkers, and follow-up information. We show that the staging provided by the model on 582 amyloid positive testing individuals has high face validity with respect to the clinical diagnosis. Using follow-up measurements largely reduces the prediction uncertainties, while the transition from normal to pathological stages is mostly associated with the increase of brain hypo-metabolism, temporal atrophy, and worsening of clinical scores. The proposed formulation of DPM provides a statistical reference for the accurate probabilistic assessment of the pathological stage of de-novo individuals, and represents a valuable instrument for quantifying the variability and the diagnostic value of biomarkers across disease stages.},

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive decline in the cognitive functions accompanied by an atrophic process which can already be observed in the early stages using magnetic resonance images (MRI). Individualized prediction of future progression to AD, when patients are still in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, has potential impact for preventive treatment. Atrophy patterns extracted from longitudinal MRI sequences provide valuable information to identify MCI patients at higher risk of developing AD in the future. We present a novel descriptor that uses the similarity between local image patches to encode local displacements due to atrophy between a pair of longitudinal MRI scans. Using a conventional logistic regression classifier, our descriptor achieves 76{\%} accuracy in predicting which MCI patients will progress to AD up to 3 years before conversion.},

abstract = {A large number of papers have introduced novel machine learning and feature extraction methods for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, while the vast majority of these works use the public dataset ADNI for evaluation, they are difficult to reproduce because different key components of the validation are often not readily available. These components include selected participants and input data, image preprocessing and cross-validation procedures. The performance of the different approaches is also difficult to compare objectively. In particular, it is often difficult to assess which part of the method (e.g. preprocessing, feature extraction or classification algorithms) provides a real improvement, if any. In the present paper, we propose a framework for reproducible and objective classification experiments in AD using three publicly available datasets (ADNI, AIBL and OASIS). The framework comprises: i) automatic conversion of the three datasets into a standard format (BIDS); ii) a modular set of preprocessing pipelines, feature extraction and classification methods, together with an evaluation framework, that provide a baseline for benchmarking the different components. We demonstrate the use of the framework for a large-scale evaluation on 1960 participants using T1 MRI and FDG PET data. In this evaluation, we assess the influence of different modalities, preprocessing, feature types (regional or voxel-based features), classifiers, training set sizes and datasets. Performances were in line with the state-of-the-art. FDG PET outperformed T1 MRI for all classification tasks. No difference in performance was found for the use of different atlases, image smoothing, partial volume correction of FDG PET images, or feature type. Linear SVM and L2-logistic regression resulted in similar performance and both outperformed random forests. The classification performance increased along with the number of subjects used for training. Classifiers trained on ADNI generalized well to AIBL and OASIS. All the code of the framework and the experiments is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at: https://gitlab.icm-institute.org/aramislab/AD-ML.},

abstract = {Dominantly-inherited Alzheimer's disease is widely hoped to hold the key to developing interventions for sporadic late onset Alzheimer's disease. We use emerging techniques in generative data-driven disease-progression modelling to characterise dominantly-inherited Alzheimer's disease progression with unprecedented resolution, and without relying upon familial estimates of years until symptom onset (EYO). We retrospectively analysed biomarker data from the sixth data freeze of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network observational study, including measures of amyloid proteins and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, regional brain volumes and cortical thicknesses, brain glucose hypometabolism, and cognitive performance from the Mini-Mental State Examination (all adjusted for age, years of education, sex, and head size, as appropriate). Data included 338 participants with known mutation status (211 mutation carriers: 163 PSEN1; 17 PSEN2; and 31 APP) and a baseline visit (age 19-66; up to four visits each, 1.1±1.9 years in duration; spanning 30 years before, to 21 years after, parental age of symptom onset). We used an event-based model to estimate sequences of biomarker changes from baseline data across disease subtypes (mutation groups), and a differential-equation model to estimate biomarker trajectories from longitudinal data (up to 66 mutation carriers, all subtypes combined). The two models concur that biomarker abnormality proceeds as follows: amyloid deposition in cortical then sub-cortical regions (approximately 24±11 years before onset); CSF p-tau (17±8 years), tau and A$\beta$42 changes; neurodegeneration first in the putamen and nucleus accumbens (up to 6±2 years); then cognitive decline (7±6 years), cerebral hypometabolism (4±4 years), and further regional neurodegeneration. Our models predicted symptom onset more accurately than EYO: root-mean-squared error of 1.35 years versus 5.54 years. The models reveal hidden detail on dominantly-inherited Alzheimer's disease progression, as well as providing data-driven systems for fine-grained patient staging and prediction of symptom onset with great potential utility in clinical trials.},

abstract = {Background: The association between the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ϵ4 allele and high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia before the age of 80 has been recognized for over 30 years. However, the timing and mode of action of APOE is not understood, nor has there been a detailed analysis of the effect of APOE genotype on memory, hippocampal volume, and amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) levels in cognitively normal adults. Objective: Examine the effect of APOE allelic genotype on the relationship between A$\beta$ levels, hippocampal volume, and memory in cognitively normal adults. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 989 cognitively normal older adults enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study, all of whom underwent APOE genotyping and memory assessment. A subset of this group underwent PET neuroimaging for A$\beta$ (n = 585) and MRI for hippocampal volume (n = 303). Results: APOE ϵ4 homozygotes (ϵ4/ϵ4) showed significantly worse episodic memory and higher A$\beta$ levels than ϵ4 heterozygotes. The relationship between increasing A$\beta$ levels and worse episodic memory was significant for ϵ3 homozygotes (ϵ3/ϵ3), ϵ4 heterozygotes, and strongest for ϵ4 homozygotes. There were no differences in hippocampal volume between APOE groups; the relationship between smaller hippocampal volume and worse episodic memory was significant only for ϵ4 homozygotes. Conclusion: APOE acts in a co-dominant fashion on A$\beta$ levels, episodic memory, and hippocampal volume in cognitively normal older adults. APOE ϵ4 is central to the events that lead to AD in cognitively normal older adults, likely through a quantitative role in the disruption of A$\beta$ clearance.},

Today, no standardized computational tools exist for the analysis of LNI data and widely used methods are sub-optimal for the types of data encountered in real-life studies. Linear Mixed Effects (LME) modeling, a mature approach well known in the statistics community, offers a powerful and versatile framework for analyzing real-life LNI data. This article presents the theory behind LME models, contrasts it with other popular approaches in the context of LNI, and is accompanied with an array of computational tools that will be made freely available through FreeSurfer - a popular Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) analysis software package.Our core contribution is to provide a quantitative empirical evaluation of the performance of LME and competing alternatives popularly used in prior longitudinal structural MRI studies, namely repeated measures ANOVA and the analysis of annualized longitudinal change measures (e.g. atrophy rate). In our experiments, we analyzed MRI-derived longitudinal hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness measurements from a public dataset consisting of Alzheimer's patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. Our results suggest that the LME approach offers superior statistical power in detecting longitudinal group differences. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease, with no effective treatment or cure. A gold standard therapy would be treatment to slow or halt disease progression; however, knowledge of causation in the early stages of AD is very limited. In order to determine effective endpoints for possible therapies, a number of quantitative surrogate markers of disease progression have been suggested, including biochemical and imaging biomarkers. The dynamics of these various surrogate markers over time, particularly in relation to disease development, are, however, not well characterized. We reviewed the literature for studies that measured cerebrospinal fluid or plasma amyloid-$\beta$ and tau, or took magnetic resonance image or fluorodeoxyglucose/Pittsburgh compound B-positron electron tomography scans, in longitudinal cohort studies. We summarized the properties of the major cohort studies in various countries, commonly used diagnosis methods and study designs. We have concluded that additional studies with repeat measures over time in a representative population cohort are needed to address the gap in knowledge of AD progression. Based on our analysis, we suggest directions in which research could move in order to advance our understanding of this complex disease, including repeat biomarker measurements standardization and increased sample sizes.},
